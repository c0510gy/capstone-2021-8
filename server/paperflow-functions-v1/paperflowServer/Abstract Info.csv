1732404,"A ship, moving with small acceleration in a reservoir of uniform depth, can be subjected to a sudden hydrodynamical impact similar to collision with an underwater rock, and on water surface unusual solitary wave will start running. The factors responsible for formation of solitons induced by a moving ship are analyzed. Emphasis is given to a phenomenon observed by John Scott Russell more 170 years ago when a sudden stop of a boat preceded the occurrence of exotic water dome. In dramatic changes of polemic about the stability and mathematical description of a solitary wave, the question why ""Russell's wave"" occurred has not been raised, though attempts its recreation invariably suffered failure. In our report the conditions disclosing the principle of the famous event as a critical phenomenon are described. In a reservoir of uniform depth a ship can confront by a dynamic barrier within narrow limits of ship's speed and acceleration. In a wider interval of parameters a ship generates a satellite wave, which can be transformed in a different-locking soliton. These phenomena can be classified into an extensive category of dynamic barrier effects including the transition of aircrafts through the sound barrier."
1732405,We propose a general derivation of differential cross section in quark-quark and quark-gluon scatterings at fixed impact parameters. The derivation is well defined and free of ambiguity in the conventional one. The approach can be applied to a variety of partonic and hadronic scatterings in low- or high-energy particle collisions.
1732406,"Let $\bbK=\mathbb R, \mathbb C, \mathbb H$ be the field of real, complex or quaternionic numbers and $M_{p, q}(\bbK)$ the vector space of all $p\times q$-matrices. Let $X$ be the matrix unit ball in $M_{n-r, r}(\bbK)$ consisting of contractive matrices. As a symmetric space, $X=G/K=O(n-r, r)/O(n-r)\times O(r)$, $U(n-r, r)/U(n-r)\times U(r)$ and respectively $Sp(n-r, r)/Sp(n-r)\times Sp(r)$. The matrix unit ball $y_0$ in $M_{r^\prime-r, r}$ with $r^\prime \le n-1$ is a totally geodesic submanifold of $X$ and let $Y$ be the set of all $G$-translations of the submanifold $y_0$. The set $Y$ is then a manifold and an affine symmetric space. We consider the Radon transform $\mathcal Rf(y)$ for functions $f\in C_0^\infty(X)$ defined by integration of $f$ over the subset $y$, and the dual transform $\mathcal R^t F(x), x\in X$ for functions $F(y)$ on $Y$. We find inversion formulas by constructing explicit certain invariant differential operators."
1732407,"We present preliminary results of an optical survey for Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in the northern part of the Galactic Bulge. In particular, observations at wavelengths corresponding to the [O III] 5007 emission line have been carried out with the 0.3 m telescope at Skinakas Observatory, where we have detected several new PNe and have rediscovered known and known-possible PNe from that region."
1732408,"We present sensitive, high angular resolution molecular line observations of C18O and N2H+ toward the dark globule B68. We directly compare these data with the near-infrared extinction measurements of Alves, Lada, & Lada to derive the first evidence for the depletion of N2H+, and by inference N2, in a prestellar dark cloud. We also find widespread C18O depletion throughout the centrally condensed core of the B68 cloud. Specifically, we find the N2H+ emission to peak in a shell partially surrounding the peak of dust extinction. Moreover, N2H+ peaks inside the much larger C18O depletion hole and has a smaller depletion zone, confirming theoretical predictions. These data are analyzed through a direct coupling of time-dependent chemical models to a radiation transfer code. This analysis highlights the importance of photodissociation at cloud edges and suggests that the CO abundance declines by 2 orders of magnitude from edge to center. In contrast, N2H+ declines in abundance, at minimum, by at least a factor of 2. Indeed, it is entirely possible that both N2H+ and N2 are completely absent from the central regions of the B68 core. The depletion of N2H+, and its parent molecule N2, opens up the possibility that the centers of dense cores, prior to the formation of a star, may evade detection by conventional methods of probing cores using molecular emission. Under these conditions, H2D+ may be the sole viable molecular probe of the innermost regions of star-forming cores."
1732409,The last years have been an exciting period for the field of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) research. With recent CMB balloon-borne and ground-based experiments we are entering a new era of 'precision' cosmology that enables us to use the CMB anisotropy measurements to constrain the cosmological parameters and test new theoretical scenarios.
1732410,"This paper summarises a numerical investigation of phase mixing in time-independent Hamiltonian systems that admit a coexistence of regular and chaotic phase space regions, allowing also for low amplitude perturbations idealised as periodic driving, friction, and/or white and colored noise. The evolution of initially localised ensembles of orbits was probed through lower order moments and coarse-grained distribution functions. In the absence of time-dependent perturbations, regular ensembles disperse initially as a power law in time and only exhibit a coarse-grained approach towards an invariant equilibrium over comparatively long times. Chaotic ensembles generally diverge exponentially fast on a time scale related to a typical finite time Lyapunov exponent, but can exhibit complex behaviour if they are impacted by the effects of cantori or the Arnold web. Viewed over somewhat longer times, chaotic ensembles typical converge exponentially towards an invariant or near-invariant equilibrium. This, however, need not correspond to a true equilibrium, which may only be approached over very long time scales. Time-dependent perturbations can dramatically increase the efficiency of phase mixing, both by accelerating the approach towards a near-equilibrium and by facilitating diffusion through cantori or along the Arnold web so as to accelerate the approach towards a true equilibrium. The efficacy of such perturbations typically scales logarithmically in amplitude, but is comparatively insensitive to most other details, a conclusion which reinforces the interpretation that the perturbations act via a resonant coupling."
1732411,"Recent observations of excess radiation at extreme ultraviolet and hard X-ray energies straddling the well known thermal soft X-ray emission have provided new tools and puzzles for investigation of the acceleration of nonthermal particles in the intercluster medium of clusters of galaxies. It is shown that these radiations can be produced by the inverse Compton upscattering of the cosmic microwave background photons by the same population of relativistic electrons that produce the well known diffuse radio radiation via the synchrotron mechanism. It is shown that the commonly discussed discrepancy between the value of the magnetic field required for the production of these radiation with that obtained from Faraday rotation measures could be resolved by more realistic models and by considerations of observational selection effects. In a brief discussion of the acceleration process it is argued that the most likely scenario is reacceleration of injected relativistic electrons involving shocks and turbulence. The seed electrons cannot be the background thermal electrons because of energetic considerations, and a steady state situation may not agree with the details of the observed spectra. Episodic generation of shocks and turbulence or episodic injection of relativistic electrons is a more likely scenario for acceleration."
1732412,"The aim of the present article is to give an overview of spectral theory on metric graphs guided by spectral geometry on discrete graphs and manifolds. We present the basic concept of metric graphs and natural Laplacians acting on it and explicitly allow infinite graphs. Motivated by the general form of a Laplacian on a metric graph, we define a new type of combinatorial Laplacian. With this generalised discrete Laplacian, it is possible to relate the spectral theory on discrete and metric graphs. Moreover, we describe a connection of metric graphs with manifolds. Finally, we comment on Cheeger's inequality and trace formulas for metric and discrete (generalised) Laplacians."
1732413,"We present near-IR observations of AGN and star-forming objects in the field of the radio galaxy 53W002 at z=2.39. The star-forming objects, of special interest as candidate protogalactic objects, are uniformly very blue in continuum slope, which fits with the strong Lyman alpha emission in indicating metallicity less than half solar. They fall in a range of luminosity and metallicity not populated by local objects. NICMOS spectroscopy detects [O III] emission for two objects and sets interesting limits for the rest. These data are satisfied by model stellar populations which have been forming stars for the last 2-5 million years. We see no evidence for older populations, either in broadband colors or as redder halos around the star-forming regions. These results suggest that the compact star-forming objects we see at z=2.0-2.5 are indeed early stages in the building of galaxies, rather than transient star-forming events in larger systems. They also also permit an alternative scheme, in which these low-mass systems are blowing winds rather than self-enriching, and should fade rapidly with cosmic epoch. For the three prominent AGN at z=2.39, emission-line ratios show metallicities just as high as in nearby systems. The ""ionization cones"" appear in [O III] and H lines, with continuum reflection in some cases as well. The contrast between the AGN and fainter star-forming objects can be broadly accomodated in a hierarchical formation picture, though there are still important unknowns as to the fate of the star-forming objects.

1732414,"We compute upper limits on CMB cross-polarization by cross-correlating the PIQUE and Saskatoon experiments. We also discuss theoretical and practical issues relevant to measuring cross-polarization and illustrate them with simulations of the upcoming BOOMERanG 2002 experiment. We present a method that separates all six polarization power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE, TB, EB) without any other ""leakage"" than the familiar EE-BB mixing caused by incomplete sky coverage. Since E and B get mixed, one might expect leakage between TE and TB, between EE and EB and between BB and EB - our method eliminates this by preserving the parity symmetry under which TB and EB are odd and the other four power spectra are even.

1732415,"Intracluster gas velocity gradients have been recently detected by the authors in the Centaurus Cluster (A3526) using the Doppler shift of X-ray spectral lines with ASCA Solid-State Imaging Spectrometers. The velocity gradient was found to be maximum along a line roughly perpendicular to the direction of the incoming subgroup Cen 45 and has a correspondent velocity difference of ~(3.4+/-1.1)×103 km s-1 within a ~10' diameter region centered on the cD galaxy NGC 4696. Such bulk velocities should Comptonize the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) producing variations of intensity and temperature that can be detectable in the near future with bolometers such as BOLOCAM. In this paper we realistically estimate the expected CMBR Comptonization for the central region of A3526, using ASCA and ROSAT data to constrain the Sunyaev-Zeldovich parameter expectations."
1732416,"We have calculated the evolution of a non-thermal electron population from super-thermal (but weakly relativistic) to highly relativistic energy range in clusters of galaxies. We investigate the evolution of hard X-ray radiation due to both bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons. The bremsstrahlung component is more significant than that of inverse Compton scattering when the momentum spectra of the electron sources are steeper than $\sim P_\mathrm{e}^{-3.0}$ and vice versa in the case of Coma, where $P_\mathrm{e}$ is the electron momentum. The resultant hard X-ray spectra are flatter when the bremsstrahlung component is dominant. When the spectral indices of the source term are in the intermediate range (from $-2.5$ to $-3.5$), too much extreme ultraviolet emission is produced. Inverse-Compton-dominant models can reproduce Coma cluster results with reasonable injection rates, which are possible in cluster mergers and/or ambient gas accretion."
1732417,"We present a search for the decays B0 --> e+e-, B0 --> mu+ mu- and B0 --> e mu using data collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e-collider at SLAC. Using a dataset corresponding to 384 x 10^6 BBbar pairs, we do not find evidence of any of the three decay modes. We obtain upper limit on the branching fractions, at 90% confidence level, of B(B0 --> e+e-)< 11.3 x 10^{-8}, B(B0 --> mu+ mu-) < 5.2 x 10^{-8}, and B(B0 --> e mu) < 9.2 x 10^{-8}.

1732418,"Seven Class 0 sources mapped with SCUBA at 850 and 450 micron are modeled using a one dimensional radiative transfer code. The modeling takes into account heating from an internal protostar, heating from the ISRF, realistic beam effects, and chopping to model the normalized intensity profile and spectral energy distribution. Power law density models, n(r) ~ r^{-p}, fit all of the sources; best fit values are mostly p = 1.8 +/- 0.1, but two sources with aspherical emission contours have lower values (p ~ 1.1). Including all sources, = 1.63 +/- 0.33. Based on studies of the sensitivity of the best-fit p to variations in other input parameters, uncertainties in p for an envelope model are \Delta p = +/- 0.2. If an unresolved source (e.g., a disk) contributes 70% of the flux at the peak, p is lowered in this extreme case and \Delta p = ^{+0.2}_{-0.6}. The models allow a determination of the internal luminosity (<L_{int}> = 4.0 \lsun) of the central protostar as well as a characteristic dust temperature for mass determination (<T_{iso}> = 13.8 +/- 2.4 K). We find that heating from the ISRF strongly affects the shape of the dust temperature profile and the normalized intensity profile, but does not contribute strongly to the overall bolometric luminosity of Class 0 sources. There is little evidence for variation in the dust opacity as a function of distance from the central source. The data are well-fitted by dust opacities for coagulated dust grains with ice mantles (Ossenkopf & Henning 1994). The density profile from an inside-out collapse model (Shu 1977) does not fit the data well, unless the infall radius is set so small as to make the density nearly a power-law.

1732419,"The evolution of substructure embedded in non-dissipative dark halos is studied through N-body simulations of isolated systems, both in and out of initial equilibrium, complementing cosmological simulations of the growth of structure. We determine by both analytic calculations and direct analysis of the N-body simulations the relative importance of various dynamical processes acting on the clumps, such as the removal of material by global tides, clump-clump heating, clump-clump merging and dynamical friction. Our comparison between merging and disruption processes implies that spiral galaxies cannot be formed in a proto-system that contains a few large clumps, but can be formed through the accretion of many small clumps; elliptical galaxies form in a more clumpy environment than do spiral galaxies. Our results support the idea that the central cusp in the density profiles of dark halos is the consequence of self-limiting merging of small, dense halos. This implies that the collapse of a system of clumps/substructure is not sufficient to form a cD galaxy, with an extended envelope; plausibly subsequent accretion of large galaxies is required. Persistent streams of material from disrupted clumps can be found in the outer regions of the final system, and at an overdensity of around 0.75, can cover 10% to 30% of the sky.

1732420,"Hubble Space Telescope STIS observations of the B III resonance line at 2066A have been obtained and analyzed for two Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) B-type stars. While boron is not detected in either star, upper limits to the boron abundance are set, with 12+log(B/H) le 1.6 for both AV 304 and NGC 346-637. The upper limits are consistent with the relationship between boron and oxygen previously reported for Galactic disk stars. The SMC upper limits are discussed in light of that galaxy's star formation history, present oxygen abundance, and its present cosmic ray flux. The UV spectrum has also been used to determine the iron-group abundances in the SMC stars. For AV 304, [Fe/H]=-0.6 pm 0.2, from both an absolute and a differential analysis (with respect to the Galactic B-type star HD 36591). This is consistent with results from A-F supergiants in the SMC. A lower iron abundance is found for NGC 346-637, [Fe/H]=-1.0 pm 0.3, but this is in good agreement with the supergiant iron abundances in NGC 330,another young SMC cluster. We propose NGC 346-637 may be an unrecognized binary though, which complicates its spectral analysis. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures. Accepted to ApJ"
1732421,"We have obtained 11.7 micron and 17.9 micron images at the Keck I telescope of the circumstellar dust emission from OH 231.8+4.2, an evolved mass-losing red giant with a well studied bipolar outflow. We detect both a central unresolved point source and extended emission which is aligned with the bipolar outflow seen on larger scales. We find that the unresolved central source can be explained by an opaque, flared disk with an outer radius near 300 AU and an outer temperature of about 130 K. One possible model to explain this flaring is that the material in the disk is orbiting the central star and not simply undergoing a radial expansion. Comment: ApJ, in press"
1732422,"The von Kármán-Howarth equations are derived for three-dimensional Hall magnetohydrodynamics in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic turbulence. From these equations, we derive exact scaling laws for the third-order correlation tensors. We show how these relations are compatible with previous heuristic and numerical results. These multiscale laws provide a relevant tool to investigate the nonlinear nature of the high-frequency magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind or, more generally, in any plasma where the Hall effect is important."
1732423,The problem of estimating a complex measure made up by a linear combination of Dirac distributions centered on points of the complex plane from a finite number of its complex moments affected by additive i.i.d. Gaussian noise is considered. A random measure is defined whose expectation approximates the unknown measure under suitable conditions. An estimator of the approximating measure is then proposed as well as a new discrete transform of the noisy moments that allows to compute an estimate of the unknown measure. A small simulation study is also performed to experimentally check the goodness of the approximations.
1732424,"Using high-resolution N-body simulations of stellar discs embedded in cosmologically motivated dark matter haloes, we study the evolution of bars and the transfer of angular momentum between haloes and bars. We find that dynamical friction results in some transfer of angular momentum to the halo, but the effect is much smaller than previously found in low-resolution simulations and is incompatible with early analytical estimates. After 5 Gyr of evolution the stellar component loses only 5–7 per cent of its initial angular momentum. Mass and force resolutions are crucial for the modelling of bar dynamics. In low-resolution (300–500 pc) simulations we find that the bar slows down and angular momentum is lost relatively fast. In simulations with millions of particles reaching a resolution of 20–40 pc, the pattern speed may not change over billions of years. Our high-resolution models produce bars that are fast rotators, where the ratio of the corotation radius to the bar semi-major axis lies in the range , marginally compatible with observational results. In contrast to many previous simulations, we find that bars are relatively short. As in many observed cases, the bar semi-major axis is close to the exponential length of the disc. The transfer of angular momentum between inner and outer parts of the disc plays a very important role in the secular evolution of the disc and the bar. The bar formation increases the exponential length of the disc by a factor of 1.2–1.5. The transfer substantially increases the stellar mass in the centre of the galaxy and decreases the dark matter to baryon ratio. As the result, the central 2-kpc region is always strongly dominated by the baryonic component. At intermediate (3–10 kpc) scales the disc is sub-dominant. These models demonstrate that the efficiency of angular momentum transfer to the dark matter has been greatly overestimated. More realistic models produce bar structure in striking agreement with observational results."
1732425,"We describe a new mechanism for pulsations in evolved stars: relaxation oscillations driven by a coupling between the luminosity-dependent mass-loss rate and the H fuel abundance in a nuclear-burning shell. When mass loss is included, the outward flow of matter can modulate the flow of fuel into the shell when the stellar luminosity is close to the Eddington luminosity LEdd. When the luminosity drops below LEdd, the mass outflow declines and the shell is resupplied with fuel. This process can be repetitive. We demonstrate the existence of such oscillations and discuss the dependence of the results on the stellar parameters. In particular, we show that the oscillation period scales specifically with the mass of the H-burning relaxation shell (HBRS), defined as the part of the H-burning shell above the minimum radius at which the luminosity from below first exceeds the Eddington threshold at the onset of the mass-loss phase. For a stellar mass M* ~ 0.7 M☉, luminosity L* ~ 104 L☉, and mass-loss rate || ~ 10-5 M☉ yr-1, the oscillations have a recurrence time of ~1400 yr ~ 57τfsm, where τfsm is the timescale for modulation of the fuel-supply in the HBRS by the varying mass-loss rate. This period agrees very well with the ~1400 yr period inferred for the spacings between the shells surrounding some planetary nebulae. We also find the half-width of the luminosity peak to be ~0.39 times the oscillation period; for comparison, the observational shell thickness of ~1000 AU corresponds to ~0.36 of the spacing between pulses. We find oscillations only for models in which the luminosity of the relaxation shell is ~10%-15% of the total stellar luminosity and for which energy generation occurs through the p-p chain. We suggest this mechanism as a natural explanation for the circumnebular shells surrounding some planetary nebulae, which appear only at the end of the AGB phase."
1732426,"We present the analysis of time-resolved spectroscopy of the pulsating subdwarf B (sdB) star PG 1605+072. From our main observing run of 16 nights we have detected velocity variations at five frequencies that correspond to those found in photometry. Based on these data, there appears to be change in amplitude of the dominant modes over about a year. However, when we include extra observations to improve the frequency resolution, we find that some of the frequencies are split into two or three. Simulations suggest that the apparent amplitude variation can be at least partially explained by a series of very closely spaced frequencies around the two strongest modes. By combining observations taken over ∼300 d we conclude that some of the closely spaced modes are caused by one mode the amplitude of which is varying, however this frequency is still within ∼1 μHz of an apparently stable frequency. Because of this kind of complexity and uncertainty we advise caution when trying to identify oscillation modes in this star."
1732427,"We discuss the principles governing the selection of inflationary models for which preheating can affect the CMB. This is a (fairly small) subset of those models which have nonnegligible entropy/isocurvature perturbations on large scales during inflation. We study new models which belong to this class—two-field inflation with negative nonminimal coupling and hybrid/double/supernatural inflation models where the tachyonic growth of entropy perturbations can lead to the variation of the curvature perturbation, , on super-Hubble scales. Finally, we present evidence against recent claims for the variation of in the absence of substantial super-Hubble entropy perturbations."
1732429,"The results of a CCD survey for variability of stars in the nearby galaxy NGC 6822 are presented. The goal of the survey was to obtain good light curves of Cepheids for Fourier decomposition and to detect shorter period Cepheids. Since the program was carried out with a relatively small telescope, the Dutch 0.9 m at ESO-La Silla, the observations were unfiltered (white light, or Wh-band). The analysis revealed the presence of more than 130 variable stars. 21 population I Cepheids are detected; 6 of them were already known from previous works (Kayser, 1967). For at least three Cepheids, however, the previous identification or period was wrong. Some probable population II (W Vir) stars are also identified. The dispersion of the fundamental mode Cepheid PL relation appears to be small. Comment: 5 pages; accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics"
1732430,"This paper presents a model for the outcome of collisions between planetesimals in a debris disk and assesses the impact of collisional processes on the structure and size distribution of the disk. The model is presented by its application to Fomalhaut's collisionally replenished dust disk; a recent 450 micron image of this disk shows a clump embedded within it with a flux ~5 per cent of the total. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) SED modelling is consistent with Fomalhaut's disk having a collisional cascade size distribution extending from bodies 0.2 m in diameter down to 7 micron-sized dust. (ii) Collisional lifetime arguments imply that the cascade starts with planetesimals 1.5-4 km in diameter. Any larger bodies must be predominantly primordial. (iii) Constraints on the timescale for the ignition of the cascade are consistent with these primordial planetesimals having a distribution that extends up to 1000km, resulting in a disk mass of 5-10 times the minimum mass solar nebula. (iv) The debris disk is expected to be intrinsically clumpy, since planetesimal collisions result in dust clumps. The intrinsic clumpiness of Fomalhaut's disk is below current detection limits, but could be detectable by future observatories such as the ALMA, and could provide the only way of determining the primordial planetesimal population. (v) The observed clump could have originated in a collision between two runaway planetesimals, both larger than 1400 km diameter. It is unlikely that we should witness such an event unless both the formation of these runaways and the ignition of the collisional cascade occurred within the last ~10 Myr. (vi) Another explanation for Fomalhaut's clump is that ~5 per cent of the planetesimals in the ring are trapped in 1:2 resonance with a planet orbiting at 80 AU."
1732431,"Using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope, sensitive measurements of the H2O megamaser in NGC3079 are presented. During 2000-2001, ""high velocity"" features are seen that are red-shifted up to 225 km s(-1) with respect to the systemic velocity of the galaxy (V-LSR similar to 1120 km s(-1)). Symmetrically bracketing the systemic velocity, the H2O emission covers a velocity range of similar to 450 kms(-1) with only one potential narrow gap (similar to 20 kms (-1)) near the systemic velocity itself. Velocity drifts of individual components are not convincingly detected. It is shown that the presence of red-shifted emission and the absence of detectable velocity drifts are not inconsistent with the existence of a rotating circumnuclear maser disk at the very center of the galaxy. Significant differences in the overall line profile compared to NGC4258 and a complex morphology of the radio continuum leave, however, space for scepticism."
1732432,We present a numerical model to study the behavior of thermonuclear flames in the discontinuity approximation. This model is applied to investigate the Landau-Darrieus instability under conditions found in Type Ia supernova explosions of Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. This is a first step to explore the flame microstructure in these events. The model reproduces Landau's linearized stability analysis in early stages of the flame evolution and the stabilization in a cellular flame structure in the nonlinear stage.
1732433,"In an essay published in 1997, M. J. Harris pointed out that the development of a theoretical explanation, or ""synthesis,"" of a group of astronomical results can lead to a situation where subsequent observations are forced to fit within that framework. Moreover, new results may be reported that fit within the framework but which can no longer be reproduced following the advent of more sensitive observations that overturn the synthesis. Although Harris considered gamma-ray line transients, a similar situation regarding the collapsar model for gamma-ray bursts now holds. In two recent papers posted on astro-ph by J. S. Bloom et al., and by P. A. Price et al., the synthesis effect is illustrated with respect to the collapsar model. These authors dismiss observations that contradict the collapsar model, appeal to ""simplicity"" to justify their preferred model, and dismiss (or better yet, ignore) competing models with unscientific reasoning. Whether or not the collapsar model is correct, these papers serve as textbook examples of the synthesis effect in science."
1732434,"Surveys at mm wavelengths emphasize rare classes of extragalactic radio sources characterized by spectra keeping flat or inverted up to high frequencies (such as blazars, GPS sources, advection dominated sources, or even gamma-ray burst afterglows), which are are difficult to single out at lower frequencies where the counts are dominated by far more numerous populations. Such surveys may lead to the discovery of populations with extreme properties, such as sources of the general GPS or blazar type but peaking at mm wavelengths, whose existence is hinted by currently available data. At relatively lower flux levels mm counts are dominated by high-redshift dusty galaxies, such as those detected by SCUBA and MAMBO surveys. These data have profound implications for our understanding of the formation and early evolution of galaxies. High sensitivity surveys at cm/mm wavelengths may also detect galaxy-scale Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects due to gas heated by central active nuclei."
1732435,"The panoramic integral-field spectrograph SAURON is currently being used to map the stellar kinematics, gaseous kinematics, and stellar populations of a large number of early-type galaxies and bulges. Here, we describe SAURON observations of cold stellar disks embedded in spheroids (NGC3384, NGC4459, NGC4526), we illustrate the kinematics and ionization state of large-scale gaseous disks (NGC4278, NGC7742), and we show preliminary comparisons of SAURON data with barred galaxy N-body simulations (NGC3623)."
1732436,A new generation CCD detector called low light level CCD (L3CCD) that performs like an intensified CCD without incorporating a micro channel plate (MCP) for light amplification was procured and tested. A series of short exposure images with millisecond integration time has been obtained. The L3CCD is cooled to about $-80^\circ$ C by Peltier cooling.
1732437,"We consider the nature of orbits near the solar neighborhood which are perturbed by local spiral arms and the Milky Way bar. We present a simplified Hamiltonian model which includes resonant terms from both types of perturbations and is similar to the forced pendulum. Via numerical integration of this model we construct Poincare maps to illustrate the nature and stability of the phase space. We find that resonance overlap is most likely to cause widespread chaos when the pattern of the spiral structure puts the solar neighborhood near the 2:1 inner Lindblad resonance (ILR) in the case of a 2-armed pattern, or near the 4:1 ILR in the case of a 4-armed pattern. When this happens both the quasiperiodic orbits which support the spiral structure and those that oscillate with the bar are disrupted near the bar's 2:1 outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). Consequently the pattern speed of spiral structure which passes through the OLR must be faster than 0.45 times the solar neighborhood angular rotation rate if it is 2-armed or faster than 0.75 times this value if it is 4-armed. Alternatively the OLR may form a boundary between spiral modes at different pattern speeds. In all cases we find that spiral structure is disrupted by the OLR over a narrow range of radius and the extent of the orbits aligned perpendicular to the bar at the OLR is limited by the spiral perturbations.

1732438,We present a new analysis of the irrelevance of Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (LPL) graduate students at the University of Arizona. Based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations we find that the actual number of useful results from LPL graduate students is $0\pm0.01 (5\sigma)$. Their irrelevance quotient far surpasses that of string theorists.
1732439,"We present the results of our search for faint Local Group dwarf galaxies in compact high-velocity clouds (HVCs). We used digitized Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) data to examine 1 square degree of sky around each of ~250 northern hemisphere HVCs. The POSS images were processed to remove foreground stars and large-scale backgrounds, smoothed to enhance arcminute-sized low surface brightness features, and then compared to the original plates. Using this technique, we located 60 candidate dwarf galaxies in the ~250 square degrees that we surveyed. Followup observations of these candidates have revealed several distant clusters of galaxies and a number of possible Galactic cirrus clouds, but no Local Group dwarfs. It appears that many of the low surface brightness features in the sky survey data are plate flaws. The second-generation red POSS plates are sensitive down to surface brightness levels of 25-26 magnitudes per square arcsecond, and our followup images reached 10-sigma limiting magnitudes of R = 21-23 for point sources. Given these limits, all known Local Group galaxies except four of the very diffuse, extended dwarf spheroidals located within 100 kpc of the Milky Way would have been detected had they been in our survey. Therefore, we can rule out the possibility that these HVCs are associated with normal but faint dwarf galaxies. If compact HVCs do contain stars, they must have surface brightnesses > 1 magnitude per square arcsecond fainter than most known Local Group galaxies.

1732440,"In cold dark matter models, a galaxy's dark matter halo is more spatially extended than its stars. However, even though the five well-constrained gravitational lenses with time delay measurements must have similar dark matter distributions, reconciling the Hubble constant estimated from their time delays with local estimates is possible only if that dark matter distribution is as compact as the luminous galaxy. The Hubble constant is H0=48-4+7 km/s Mpc (95% confidence) if the lenses have flat rotation curves and H0=71+/-6 km/s Mpc (95% confidence) if they have constant mass-to-light ratios, as compared to H0=72+/-8 km/s Mpc (68% confidence) for local estimates by the HST Key Project. Either all five H0 estimates based on the lenses are wrong, local estimates of H0 are too high, or dark matter distributions are more concentrated than expected. The average value for H0 including the uncertainties in the mass distribution, H0=62+/-7 km/s Mpc, has uncertainties that are competitive with local estimates. However, by selecting a value for H0 you also determine the dark matter distribution of galaxies."
1732441,"By radiation transfer models with a realistic power spectra of the projected density distributions, we show that the optical properties of grains are poorly constrained by observations of reflection nebulae. The ISM is known to be hierarchically clumped from a variety of observations (molecules, H I, far-infrared). Our models assume the albedo and phase parameter of the dust, the radial optical depth of the sphere averaged over all directions, and random distributions of the dust within the sphere. The outputs are the stellar extinction, optical depth, and flux of scattered light as seen from various viewing angles. Observations provide the extinction and scattered flux from a particular direction. Hierarchical geometry has a large effect on the flux of scattered light emerging from a nebula for a particular extinction of the exciting star. There is a very large spread in both scattered fluxes and extinctions for any distribution of dust. Consequently, an observed stellar extinction and scattered flux can be fitted by a wide range of albedos. With hierarchical geometry it is not completely safe to determine even relative optical constants from multiwavelength observations of the same reflection nebula. The geometry effectively changes with wavelength as the opacity of the clumps varies. Limits on the implications of observing the same object in various wavelengths are discussed briefly. Henry (2002) uses a recipe to determine the scattered flux from a star with a given extinction. It is claimed to be independent of the geometry. It provides considerably more scattering than our models, probably leading to an underestimate of the grain albedos from the UV Diffuse Galactic Light. Comment: 27 pages, including 7 figures.

1732443,"Living communities can be considered as complex systems, thus a fertile ground for studies related to their statistics and dynamics. In this study we revisit the case of the rhythmic applause by utilizing the model proposed by V\'azquez et al. [A. V\'azquez et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 036127 (2006)] augmented with two contradicted {\it driving forces}, namely: {\it Individuality} and {\it Companionship}. To that extend, after performing computer simulations with a large number of oscillators we propose an explanation on the following open questions (a) why synchronization occurs suddenly, and b) why synchronization is observed when the clapping period ($T_c$) is $1.5 \cdot T_s < T_c < 2.0 \cdot T_s$ ($T_s$ is the mean self period of the spectators) and is lost after a time. Moreover, based on the model, a weak preferential attachment principle is proposed which can produce complex networks obeying power law in the distribution of number edges per node with exponent greater than 3.

1732444,"We present 30-GHz Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) observations of a sample of four galaxy clusters with a prototype of the One Centimetre Receiver Array (OCRA-p) which is mounted on the Torun 32-m telescope. The clusters (Cl 0016+16, MS 0451.6–0305, MS 1054.4–0321 and Abell 2218) are popular SZ targets and serve as commissioning observations. All four are detected with clear significance (4 –6σ) and values for the central temperature decrement are in good agreement with measurements reported in the literature. We believe that systematic effects are successfully suppressed by our observing strategy. The relatively short integration times required to obtain these results demonstrate the power of OCRA-p and its successors for future SZ studies."
1732445,We study contact manifolds that arise as cyclic branched covers of transverse knots in the standard contact 3-sphere. We discuss properties of these contact manifolds and describe them in terms of open books and contact surgeries. In many cases we show that such branched covers are contactomorphic for smoothly isotopic transverse knots with the same self-linking number. These pairs of knots include most of the nontransversely simple knots of Birman–Menasco and Ng–Ozsváth–Thurston.

In this paper, we show that these quartics coincide with the Scorza quartics of general pairs of trigonal curves and ineffective theta characteristics. Among other applications, we give an affirmative answer to the conjecture of Dolgachev and Kanev on the existence of the Scorza quartics for any general pairs of curves and ineffective theta characteristics.

1732447,"We report on a numerical study of viscous fluid accretion onto a black hole. The flow is axisymmetric and uses a pseudo-Newtonian potential to model relativistic effects near the event horizon. The numerical method is a variant of the ZEUS code. As a test of our numerical scheme, we are able to reproduce results from earlier, similar work by Igumenshchev and Abramowicz and Stone and coworkers. We consider models in which mass is injected onto the grid as well as models in which an initial equilibrium torus is accreted. In each model we measure three ""eigenvalues"" of the flow: the accretion rate of mass, angular momentum, and energy. We find that the eigenvalues are sensitive to rin, the location of the inner radial boundary. Only when the flow is always supersonic on the inner boundary are the eigenvalues insensitive to small changes in rin. We also report on the sensitivity of the results to other numerical parameters."
1732448,"We derive the bolometric to X-ray correlation for a local sample of normal and starburst galaxies and use it, in combination with several UV reddening schemes, to predict the 2--8 keV X-ray luminosity for a sample of 24 Lyman-break galaxies in the HDF/CDF-N. We find that the mean X-ray luminosity, as predicted from the Meurer UV reddening relation for starburst galaxies, agrees extremely well with the Brandt stacking analysis. This provides additional evidence that Lyman-break galaxies can be considered as scaled-up local starbursts and that the locally derived starburst UV reddening relation may be a reasonable tool for estimating the UV extinction at high redshift. Our analysis shows that the Lyman-break sample can not have far-IR to far-UV flux ratios similar to nearby ULIGs, as this would predict a mean X-ray luminosity 100 times larger than observed, as well as far-IR luminosities large enough to be detected in the sub-mm. We calculate the UV reddening expected from the Calzetti effective starburst attenuation curve and the radiative transfer models of Witt & Gordon for low metallicity dust in a shell geometry with homogeneous or clumpy dust distributions and find that all are consistent with the observed X-ray emission. Finally, we show that the mean X-ray luminosity of the sample would be under predicted by a factor of 6 if the the far-UV is unattenuated by dust. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures.

1732449,"A novel model for collimation and transport of electron-positron-ion jets is presented. Analytical results show that the filamentary structures can be sustained by self-induced toroidal magnetic fields permeating through the filaments, whose widths significantly expand in the pair-dominant regimes. The magnetic field strength reflects a characteristic of equipartition of excess kinetic energy of the jets. It is also shown that growth of the hoselike instability is strongly suppressed. Essential features derived from this model are consistent with recent results observed by using very long baseline telescopes.

1732450,"The 1s2-1s2l lines are the most intense He-like ions lines. They are used as spectroscopic diagnostics for solar active regions as well as for different laboratory plasmas. Nowadays, it exits very high spectral resolution instruments and, for intense X-ray sources, one can do spectroscopic diagnostics from line ratios. With XMM (RGS) and Chandra (LETGS, HETGS) spectral resolutions and for several atomic elements, it is particularly possible to separate a 3 blended line set, the so-called He-like triplet: Resonance (r), Intercombination (i) and Forbidden (f), which are dominated respectively by lines issued from the following levels : 1s2p 1P1, 1s2p 3P1,2 and 1s2s 3S1. We shall show that the measurement of two different ratios between these 3 lines (R = f/i and G = (f + i)/r) give quantitative informations on the nature of the emitting plasma (photo-ionized or collisional) and on its electronic density and temperature. A more refined analysis must also include satellite line contributions."

1732452,"We present the results of BeppoSAX observations of the young X-ray pulsar PSR J1846-0258, recently discovered at the center of the composite supernova remnant Kes 75. The pulsar (plus nebula) spectrum can be fitted by an absorbed power law with photon index alpha_ph=2.16+/-0.15, N_H=(4.7+/-0.8) x 10^22 cm^-2, and unabsorbed flux ~3.9x10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1 (2-10 keV). By joining two observations taken at an interval of two weeks we have been able to obtain a precise measurement of the spin period (P=324.818968+/-0.000006 ms). This value, when combined with previous measurements, cannot be fitted by a smooth frequency evolution with a canonical braking index n=3. With the hypothesis of no glitches and/or significant timing noise, the braking index would be n=1.86+/-0.08 and, assuming a short initial period, the pulsar age would be \~1700 years, closer to that of the supernova remnant than the simple estimate \tau=P/2\pdot=723 years. Other likely possibilities involve the presence of glitches and lead to a wide range of acceptable ages. For example, we obtain n in the range 1.8-2.5, if a glitch occurred near MJD 51500, while for a glitch between October 1993 and March 1999 we can only get a lower limit of n>1.89.

1732453,"We have imaged the H92alpha and H75alpha radio recombination line (RRL) emissions from the starburst galaxy NGC 253 with a resolution of ~4 pc. The peak of the RRL emission at both frequencies coincides with the unresolved radio nucleus. Both lines observed towards the nucleus are extremely wide, with FWHM of ~200 km /s. Modeling the RRL and radio continuum data for the radio nucleus shows that the lines arise in gas whose density is ~10^4 \cc and mass is few thousand Msun, which requires an ionizing flux of (6-20)x10^{51} photons /s. We consider a SNR expanding in a dense medium, a star cluster and also an AGN as potential ionizing sources. Based on dynamical arguments, we rule out an SNR as a viable ionizing source. A star cluster model was considered and the dynamics of the ionized gas in a stellar-wind driven structure was investigated. Such a model is consistent with the properties of the ionized gas only for a cluster younger than ~10^5 years. The existence of such a young cluster at the nucleus seems improbable. The third model assumes the ionizing source to be an AGN at the nucleus. In this model, it was shown that the observed X-ray flux is too weak to account for the required ionizing photon flux. However, the ionization requirement can be explained if the accretion disk is assumed to have a Big Blue Bump in its spectrum. Hence, we favor an AGN at the nucleus as the source responsible for ionizing the observed RRLs. A hybrid model consisting of a inner ADAF disk and an outer thin disk is suggested, which could explain the radio, UV and the X-ray luminosities of the nucleus."
1732454,"We report on a dramatic transition between a Compton-thick, reflection-dominated state and a Compton-thin state in the Seyfert 2 galaxy UGC4203, discovered by comparing a recent (May 2001) XMM-Newton observation with ASCA observations performed about six years earlier. This transition can be explained either as a change in the column density of the absorber, maybe due to moving clouds in a clumpy torus, or as the revival of a transient active nucleus, which was in a phase of very low activity when observed by ASCA. If the latter explanation is correct, spectral transitions of this kind provide observational support to the idea that Compton-thick and Compton-thin regions coexist in the same source, the former likely to be identified with the ""torus"", the latter with dust lanes on much larger scales.

1732455,"We investigate the chances that neutron stars act as the lense in a gravitational microlensing event towards the galactic bulge or a spiral arm. The observation of neutron stars by means of gravitational microlensing would allow the estimation of neutron star masses independently of the property of being a pulsar in a binary system. We estimate the contribution of neutron stars to the optical depth and the lensing rate based on two different models of the pulsar distribution in the galaxy. Since only a small fraction of all neutron stars are pulsars, it is unlikely to find a pulsar that acts as a microlense by chance. A position comparison of known radio pulsars with observed microlensing candidates towards the galactic bulge and spiral arms shows no candidate pair, which is consistent with the theoretical expectation. To improve the probability of microlensing a pulsar, we suggest to search for gravitational microlensing events of known nearby high proper motion pulsars. The pulsar PSR J1932+1059 is a good candidate for an astrometric detection of gravitational lensing. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, includes note added in proof, A&A in press"
1732456,"We present results of a VLBA multi-frequency study of the pc-scale twin jet in NGC1052. We observed this object at epoch 1998.99 with the VLBA at 5, 8.4, 22 and 43 GHz both in total and linearly polarized intensity. The spectral analysis confirms the necessity of a free-free absorbing medium, obscuring the innermost part of both jets. At 5 GHz we found a compact linearly polarized emission region at the base of the eastern jet with a degree of polarization of 1.5%. At higher frequencies there is no evidence for polarization in our data. A core shift analysis constrains the position of the central engine to ~0.03 pc. The shift rates of the apparent core position with frequency confirm the strong influence of free-free absorption in conjunction with steep pressure gradients at the bases of both jets."
1732457,"We examine the role of Alfven wave damping in heating the plasma in the magnetic funnels of magnetospheric accretion models of young stars. We study four different damping mechanisms of the Alfven waves: nonlinear, turbulent, viscous-resistive and collisional. Two different possible origins for the Alfven waves are discussed: 1) Alfven waves generated at the surface of the star by the shock produced by the infalling matter; and 2) Alfven waves generated locally in the funnel by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We find that, in general, the damping lengths are smaller than the tube length. Since thermal conduction in the tube is not efficient, Alfven waves generated only at the star's surface cannot heat the tube to the temperatures necessary to fit the observations. Only for very low frequency Alfven waves ~10^{-5} the ion cyclotron frequency, is the viscous-resistive damping length greater than the tube length. In this case, the Alfven waves produced at the surface of the star are able to heat the whole tube. Otherwise, local production of Alfven waves is required to explain the observations. The turbulence level is calculated for different frequencies for optically thin and thick media. We find that turbulent velocities varies greatly for different damping mechanisms, reaching \~100 km s^{-1} for the collisional damping of small frequency waves."
1732458,"We present a detailed analysis of the complex absorption apparent in the 2–6 keV X-ray spectrum of the bright nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We first utilize the large bandpass and medium spectral resolution afforded by BeppoSAX data to construct a 1–100 keV spectral template, which assumes the absorption arises in both warm (i.e. partially photoionized) and cold gas present in the line of sight to the active nucleus of the source. Application of this spectral model to an ASCA‘long-look’ observation of NGC 4151 reveals a partial correlation between the underlying continuum flux and the ionization state of the warm absorber. Such a correlation is an intrinsic property of a warm absorber and argues strongly in favour of this interpretation for the complex absorbing column over alternative partial covering models. The warm absorber in NGC 4151 has a column density of ∼2 × 1023 cm −2, with an ionization parameter in the range log(ξ) ≈ 2.4–2.7. The inferred relatively low density (∼105 cm−3) for the warm gas implies an equilibration time-scale for the dominant ions of the same order as or longer than the time-scale of the continuum variability. It follows that the warm component will invariably be observed in a non-equilibrium ionization state. The warm absorber in NGC 4151 may be identified as a multi-temperature wind produced by evaporation from the inner edge of an obscuring torus as discussed in a recent paper by Krolik & Kriss. The unusually complex character of the absorption seen in NGC 4151 may then be explained in terms of a fortuitous line of sight which grazes the top edge of the obscuring torus so as to intercept a substantial column of both the warm and cold gas. We also find that (i) the reported hardening of the spectrum of NGC 4151 as the continuum level falls may be simply due to the presence of an underlying (hard and relatively constant) Compton-reflection component, and (ii) the iron Kα line has a relatively narrow Gaussian profile and a line flux that remains constant over both short (days) and long (months to years) time-scales–a relativistically broadened iron Kα feature was not required in our modelling."

1732461,"We present results from a detailed analysis of a third eclipsing binary (EB) system in the Large Magellanic Cloud, EROS 1044 (~B2 IV-V + ~B2 III-IV). Our study combines the ""classical"" EB study of light and radial velocity curves with detailed modeling of the observed spectral energy distribution and yields an essentially complete picture of the stellar properties of the system and a determination of its distance. The observational data exploited include optical photometry, space-based UV spectroscopy, and UV/optical spectrophotometry. The advantages of our technique include numerous consistency checks and, in the case of the distance determinations, the absence of zero-point uncertainties and adjustable parameters. We find the EROS 1044 system to consist of a pair of normal, mildly evolved ~21,000 K stars, whose derived properties are consistent with stellar evolution calculations. The distance to the system is 47.5 ± 1.8 kpc. We discuss the implications of our results for three EB systems (HV 2274, HV 982, and EROS 1044) on the general distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud."

With the new generation of large radio telescopes and interferometer arrays operating in the millimeter radio bands (e.g. ALMA), the ultimate vicinity of super massive Black Holes, and eventually even their event horizon, could be imaged.

1732463,"We propose a method that uses near-infrared plus uvby photometry to identify potentially extensive circumstellar dusty environment about F and A stars. The method has been applied to a sample of ~900 metal rich reddened F stars with 2MASS and uvby data, suggesting the presence of circumstellar dust emitting in the near infrared for ~70 stars. The log T_e - M_V diagram suggests that most, if not all, of them are likely pre-mainsequence (PMS). They seem to be consistent with being a continuation of the class of Herbig Ae/Be PMS stars into the spectral type F. Their number drops sharply downward of log T_e ~ 3.84 (spectral types later than ~F5), which may provide new clues to the PMS evolution of stars with 1 to 2 solar mass. We present a list of 21 most conspicuous candidate stars with circumstellar dust. About half of them are associated with the extended star-forming region around rho Oph. The brightest of these 21 stars, with V < 7.5, turn out to be IRAS sources, suggesting the presence of heated dust emitting in the far infrared. Also in this list, HD 81270 is reported as a very unusual star moving away from the Galactic plane at a projected speed of 70 km/sec. Comment: 8 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

1732464,"An extensive sample of M, L, and T dwarfs identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has been compiled. The sample of 718 dwarfs includes 677 new objects (629 M dwarfs and 48 L dwarfs), together with 41 that have been previously published. All new objects and some of the previously published ones have new optical spectra obtained either with the SDSS spectrographs or with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m ARC telescope. Spectral types and SDSS colors are available for all objects; approximately 35% also have near-infrared magnitudes measured by 2MASS (Two Micron All Sky Survey) or on the Mauna Kea system. We use this sample to characterize the color–spectral type and color-color relations of late-type dwarfs in the SDSS filters and to derive spectroscopic and photometric parallax relations for use in future studies of the luminosity and mass functions based on SDSS data. We find that the i* - z* and i* - J colors provide good spectral type and absolute magnitude (Mi*) estimates for M and L dwarfs. Our distance estimates for the current sample indicate that SDSS is finding early M dwarfs out to ~1.5 kpc, L dwarfs to ~100 pc, and T dwarfs to ~20 pc. The T dwarf photometric data show large scatter and are therefore less reliable for spectral type and distance estimation."

1732466,"We report the discovery of variability in the OH megamaser in IRAS 21272+2514 at z=0.15. This is the first OH megamaser (OHM) observed to vary in time. The variation is broadband, spanning 0.5-1.5 MHz or 100-300 km/s in the rest frame, and strong, showing rms modulations of 10%-15% while the largest change in flux density between extremal epochs is 34%. Timescales sampled range from 39 to 821 days, and the characteristic modulation timescale is likely to be less than the shortest time baseline. The source of modulation is currently ambiguous, although we favor interstellar scintillation. Best estimates of the size scales of the 1667 MHz OH line features obtained from refractive interstellar scintillation models constrain variable features to be smaller than 2 pc, and quiescent features to be larger than a few pc. Compact masers account for roughly 27%-58% of the total OH emission in this source. Accelerations in spectral lines are generally constrained to be less than 3 km/s/yr, but acceleration of this magnitude is suggested in one of the quiescent spectral components and merits further study.

1732467,"We discuss the four-point correlation function, or the trispectrum in Fourier space, of CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies due to the weak gravitational lensing effect by intervening large scale structure. We discuss the squared temperature power spectrum as a probe of this trispectrum and, more importantly, as an observational approach to extracting the power spectrum of the deflection angle associated with the weak gravitational lensing effect on the CMB. We extend previous discussions on the trispectrum and associated weak lensing reconstruction from CMB data by calculating non-Gaussian noise contributions, beyond the previously discussed dominant Gaussian noise. Non-Gaussian noise contributions are generated by lensing itself and by the correlation between the lensing effect and other foreground secondary anisotropies in the CMB such as the Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) effect. When the SZ effect is removed from temperature maps using its spectral dependence, we find these additional non-Gaussian noise contributions to be an order of magnitude lower than the dominant Gaussian noise. If the noise-bias due to the dominant Gaussian part of the temperature squared power spectrum is removed, then these additional non-Gaussian contributions provide the limiting noise level for the lensing reconstruction. The temperature squared power spectrum allows a high signal-to-noise extraction of the lensing deflections and a confusion-free separation of the curl (or B-mode) polarization due to inflationary gravitational waves from that due to lensed gradient (or E-mode) polarization. The small angular scale temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements provide a novel approach to weak lensing studies, complementing the approach based on galaxy ellipticities."

To be more precise, however, the Sm data gives either an upper-bound or an evidence for a changing . A remark is made to a similar re-analysis due to Damour and Dyson.

1732469,"The Pluto Energetic Particle Spectrometer Science Investigation (PEPSSI) comprises the hardware and accompanying science investigation on the New Horizons spacecraft to measure pick-up ions from Pluto's outgassing atmosphere. To the extent that Pluto retains its characteristics similar to those of a ""heavy comet"" as detected in stellar occultations since the early 1980s, these measurements will characterize the neutral atmosphere of Pluto while providing a consistency check on the atmospheric escape rate at the encounter epoch with that deduced from the atmospheric structure at lower altitudes by the ALICE, REX, and SWAP experiments on New Horizons. In addition, PEPSSI will characterize any extended ionosphere and solar wind interaction while also characterizing the energetic particle environment of Pluto, Charon, and their associated system. First proposed for development for the Pluto Express mission in September 1993, what became the PEPSSI instrument went through a number of development stages to meet the requirements of such an instrument for a mission to Pluto while minimizing the required spacecraft resources. The PEPSSI instrument provides for measurements of ions (with compositional information) and electrons from 10s of keV to ~1 MeV in a 120 deg x 12 deg fan-shaped beam in six sectors for 1.5 kg and ~2.5 W."
1732470,"With the advent of Chandra and XMM, X-ray lines spectroscopy of AGN outflows is off to an exciting start. In this paper we illuminate some of the complications involved in extracting the outflow's physical conditions (ionization equilibrium, total column density, chemical abundances) from such spectroscopic data. To do so we use the example provided by high-quality FUSE and HST observations of the outflow seen in NGC 985. We show how simple determinations of the column density in the UV absorption lines often severely underestimate the real column densities. This is due to strong non-black saturation of the absorption troughs, where in many cases the UV line profile mainly reflects the velocity-dependent covering factor rather than the column density distribution. We then show that underestimating individual ionic column densities by a factor of 5 can cause a two orders of magnitude error in the inferred total column density of the outflow. In some case this will be enough to associate the UV and X-ray absorber with the same outflowing material. Finally, we note that the UV spectra of NGC 985 have 10--20 times the resolution and 2--5$\times$ the S/N per resolution element compared with the best available Chandra spectra of similar objects. Therefore, in the X-ray band non-black saturation and velocity-dependent covering factor effects will only become abundantly clear using vastly more capable future X-ray telescopes. However, by taking into consideration the lessons learned from the UV band, we can greatly improve the quality of physical constraints we extract from current X-ray data of AGN outflows."
1732471,"(Abridged) We use the statistical tool known as the ``Spectral Correlation Function"" [SCF] to intercompare simulations and observations of the atomic interstellar medium. The simulations considered mimic three distinct sets of physical conditions. One of them (run ""ISM"") is intended to represent a mixture of cool and warm atomic gas, and includes self-gravity and magnetic fields. For each simulation, H I spectral-line maps are synthesized and intercompared, both with each other, and with observations, using the SCF. We find that, when thermal broadening is large in comparison with fine-scale turbulent velocity structure, it masks sub-thermal velocity sub-structure in the synthesized spectra. The H I observations we use here for comparison are of the North Celestial Pole (NCP) Loop. None of the simulations match the NCP Loop data very well. The most realistic sets of line profiles and SCF statistics comes from artifically rescaling the velocity axis of run ISM. Without rescaling, almost all velocity structure is smeared out by thermal broadening. However, if the velocity axis is expanded by a factor of 6, the SCF distributions of run ISM an the NCP Loop match up fairly well. This means that the ratio of thermal to turbulent pressure in run ISM is much too large as it stands, and that the simulation is deficient in turbulent energy. This is a consequence of run ISM not including the effects of supernovae. We conclude that the SCF is a useful tool for understanding and fine-tuning simulations of interstellar gas, and in particular that realistic simulations of the atomic ISM need to include the effects of energetic stellar winds (e.g. supernovae) in order for the ratio of thermal-to-turbulent pressure to give spectra representative of the observed interstellar medium in our Galaxy.

1732472,We report the most complete imaging of CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) molecular gas emission in the star-forming spiral galaxy NGC 6946.
1732473,"We propose a hypothesis of the truncation of stellar discs based on the magnetic model of the rotation curve of spiral galaxies. Once the disc had formed and acquired its present structure, approximately, three balanced forces were acting on the initial gas: gravity and magnetic forces, inwards, and centrifugal force. When stars are formed from this gas, the magnetic force is suddenly suppressed. Gravitation alone cannot retain the newly-formed stars and at birth places beyond a certain galactocentric radius they escape to intergalactic space. This radius is the so-called ``truncation radius'', which is predicted to be at about 4-5 disc radial scale lengths, in promising agreement with observations.

1732474,"We show that the category of representations of the Euclidean group of orientation-preserving isometries of two-dimensional Euclidean space is equivalent to the category of representations of the preprojective algebra of infinite type A. We also consider the moduli space of representations of the Euclidean group along with a set of generators. We show that these moduli spaces are quiver varieties of the type considered by Nakajima. Using these identifications, we prove various results about the representation theory of the Euclidean group. In particular, we prove it is of wild representation type but that if we impose certain restrictions on weight decompositions, we obtain only a finite number of indecomposable representations.

1732475,"I review at the non-specialist level recent progress in the study of the large-scale structure of the Universe, covering the following areas: (1) Results from recently completed or ongoing redshift surveys of galaxies and X-ray clusters; (2) Measurements of the power spectrum of fluctuations approaching Gpc scales; (3) Redshift-space distortions and their cosmological use; (4) Structure at high redshifts and its connection to galaxy formation."
1732476,"Now that gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been determined to lie at cosmological distances, their isotropic burst energies are estimated to be as high as 1054 erg (ref. 2), making them the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. The nature of the progenitors responsible for the bursts remains, however, elusive. The favoured models range from the merger of two neutron stars in a binary system to the collapse of a massive star. Spectroscopic studies of the afterglow emission could reveal details of the environment of the burst, by indicating the elements present, the speed of the outflow and an estimate of the temperature. Here we report an X-ray spectrum of the afterglow of GRB011211, which shows emission lines of magnesium, silicon, sulphur, argon, calcium and possibly nickel, arising in metal-enriched material with an outflow velocity of the order of one-tenth the speed of light. These observations strongly favour models where a supernova explosion from a massive stellar progenitor precedes the burst event and is responsible for the outflowing matter."
1732477,"About 200 X-ray sources from a sample of spectrally hard ROSAT PSPC sources, given in the catalog of Haberl & Pietsch (1999), and observed in a ~60 square degree field of the LMC during several archival pointed observations with a wide range of exposure times have been reanalyzed. For these sources accurate count rates and hardness ratios have been recalculated. In comparison to Haberl & Pietsch (1999) we used merged data from all available observations and we derived average source parameters by investigating each source individually. From a simulation powerlaw spectral tracks have been derived in the HR1 - HR2 plane and ~170 sources have been classified as background X-ray sources or as LMC X-ray binaries. 80% of the spectrally hard X-ray sources with more than 50 observed counts have been found to be consistent with background X-ray sources and 20% with LMC X-ray binaries (53 sources with AGN and 15 with X-ray binaries). The discovery of a new supersoft source RX J0529.4-6713 at the southern HI boundary of the supergiant shell LMC4 is reported. We find two new candidate X-ray binary systems which are associated with the optical bar of the LMC and additional candidate X-ray binaries which are associated with supergiant shells.

1732478,"In this series of papers we investigate the orbital structure of 3D models representing barred galaxies. In the present introductory paper we use a fiducial case to describe all families of periodic orbits that may play a role in the morphology of three-dimensional bars. We show that, in a 3D bar, the backbone of the orbital structure is not just the x1 family, as in 2D models, but a tree of 2D and 3D families bifurcating from x1. Besides the main tree we have also found another group of families of lesser importance around the radial 3:1 resonance. The families of this group bifurcate from x1 and influence the dynamics of the system only locally. We also find that 3D orbits elongated along the bar minor axis can be formed by bifurcations of the planar x2 family. They can support 3D bar-like structures along the minor axis of the main bar. Banana-like orbits around the stable Lagrangian points build a forest of 2D and 3D families as well. The importance of the 3D x1-tree families at the outer parts of the bar depends critically on whether they are introduced in the system as bifurcations in $z$ or in $\dot{z}$.

1732479,"We investigate the orbital structure in a class of 3D models of barred galaxies. We consider different values of the pattern speed, of the strength of the bar and of the parameters of the central bulge of the galactic model. The morphology of the stable orbits in the bar region is associated with the degree of folding of the x1-characteristic. This folding is larger for lower values of the pattern speed. The elongation of rectangular-like orbits belonging to x1 and to x1-originated families depends mainly on the pattern speed. The detailed investigation of the trees of bifurcating families in the various models shows that major building blocks of 3D bars can be supplied by families initially introduced as unstable in the system, but becoming stable at another energy interval. In some models without radial and vertical 2:1 resonances we find, except for the x1 and x1-originated families, also families related to the z-axis orbits, which support the bar. Bifurcations of the x2 family can build a secondary 3D bar along the minor axis of the main bar. This is favoured in the slow rotating bar case.

1732480,"We present the first CCD mosaic of the supernova remnant G 65.3+5.7 in the optical emission lines of [O II] and [O III]. The new images reveal several diffuse and filamentary structures both inside and outside the extent of the remnant as defined by its X-ray and radio emission. The medium ionization line of [O III] 5007 provides the sharpest view to the system, while the remnant appears less filamentary in the emission line of [O II]. There are significant morphological differences between the two images strongly suggesting the presence of incomplete shock structures. Deep long-slit spectra were taken at several different positions of G 65.3+5.7. All spectra originate from shock heated gas, while the majority of them is characterized by large [O III]/Hbeta ratios. The sulfur line ratios indicate electron densities below ~200 cm^{-3}, while estimates of the shock velocities lie in the range of 90-140 km/s. Finally, the observed variations of the Halpha/Hbeta ratios may reflect the presence of intrinsic absorption affecting the optical spectra.

1732481,"Basic energy requirements of Gamma Ray Burst(GRB) sources can be easily accounted for by a pair creation process occurring in the ""Dyadosphere"" of a Black Hole endowed with an electromagnetic field (abbreviated to EMBH for ""electromagnetic Black Hole""). This includes the recent observations of GRB971214 by Kulkarni et al. The ""Dyadosphere"" is defined as the region outside the horizon of an EMBH where the electromagnetic field exceeds the critical value for e^+ e^- pair production. In a very short time $\sim O(hbar mc^2}), very large numbers of pairs are created there. Further evolution then leads naturally to a relativistically expanding pair-electromagnetic-pulse (PEM-pulse). Specific examples of Dyadosphere parameters are given for 10 and 10^5 solar mass EMBH's. This process does occur for EMBH with charge-to-mass ratio larger than 2.210^{-5} and strictly smaller than one. From a fundamental point of view, this process represents the first mechanism proved capable of extracting large amounts of energy from a Black Hole with an extremely high efficiency (close to 100%)."
1732482,"Highly relativistic jets are most probably driven by strong magnetic fields and launched from the accretion disk surrounding a central black hole. Applying the jet flow parameters (velocity, density, temperature) calculated from the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, we derive the thermal X- ray luminosity along the inner jet flow in the energy range 0.2-10.1 keV. Here, we concentrate on the case of Galactic microquasars emitting highly relativistic jets. For a 5 M- circle dot central object and a jet mass flow rate of (M)over dot(j) = 10(8) M-circle dot yr(-1) we obtain a jet X-ray luminosity L-X approximate to 10(33) erg s(-1). Emission lines of Fe XXV and Fe XXVI are clearly visible. Relativistic effects such as Doppler shift and boosting were considered for different inclinations of the jet axis. Due to the chosen geometry of the MHD jet the inner X-ray emitting part is not yet collimated. Therefore, depending on the viewing angle, the Doppler boosting does not play a major role in the total spectr"
1732483,"In this series of two papers we present a high dispersion spectroscopic analysis of 8 candidate extremely metal poor stars selected from the Hamburg/ESO Survey and of 6 additional very metal poor stars. We demonstrate that with suitable vetting using moderate-resolution spectra the yield of this survey for stars with [Fe/H] $\le -3.0$ dex is very high; three out of the eight stars observed thus far at high resolution from the HES are actually that metal poor, three more have [Fe/H] $\le -2.8$ dex, and the remainder are only slightly more metal rich. In preparation for a large scale effort to mine the Hamburg/ESO Survey database for such stars about to get underway, we lay out in this paper the basic principles we intend to use to determine in a uniform way the stellar parameters Teff, surface grav, and reddening.

1732484,"We present spectroscopic observations with Keck/LRIS of LBQS 0015+0239, a pair of quasars at z = 2.45 with a separation of $\Delta\theta = 2.2$ arcsec (projected linear distance of 17.8 $h_{70}^{-1}$ kpc, for $\Omega_m = 0.3$, $\Lambda = 0.7$). Lensing is an unlikely interpretation for the images, since the spectra show significant differences in the NV and CIV emission line profiles, and there is no luminous galaxy at the anticipated lens position. Rather, we interpret this pair as the highest redshift known example of a binary quasar. The redshift difference of 661+/-173 km/s between the two components is inconsistent with the lensing expectation, but is consistent with the line of sight velocity difference of a bound pair of galaxies. The spectra show associated, narrow metal absorption in highly ionized species of C and N, with a systemic velocity difference of 492+/-6 km/s. It is likely that this absorption arises in a group or cluster of galaxies surrounding the quasar pair. After a thorough search, the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS) is known to contain one gravitational lens and four probable binary pairs. The existence of close binaries is evidence that quasar activity can be triggered by galaxy interactions. We speculate that the close pair LBQS 0015+0239 is a rare example of the pre-merger state of two supermassive black holes.

1732485,"The effective KN interaction based on chiral SU(3) coupled-channel dynamics is derived and its extrapolation below the KN threshold is studied in detail. Starting from the coupled-channel scattering equations, we eliminate the channels other than KN and obtain an effective interaction in the single KN channel. An equivalent local potential in coordinate space is constructed such as to reproduce the full scattering amplitude of the chiral SU(3) coupled-channel framework. We discuss several realistic chiral SU(3)-based models in comparison to reach conclusions about the uncertainties involved. It turns out that, in the region relevant to the discussion of deeply bound K-nuclear few-body systems, the resulting energy-dependent, equivalent local potential is substantially less attractive than the one suggested in previous purely phenomenological treatments."
1732486,"We propose a method for determining the CP nature of a neutral Higgs boson or spin-zero resonance ϕ at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in its ϕ→τ−τ+ decay channel. The method can be applied to any 1-prong τ-decay mode, which comprise the majority of the τ-lepton decays. The proposed observables allow to discriminate between pure scalar and pseudoscalar Higgs-boson states and/or between a CP-conserving and CP-violating Higgs sector. We show for the decays τ→πντ that the method maintains its discriminating power when measurement uncertainties are taken into account. The method will be applicable also at a future linear e+e− collider."
1732487,"The nonlinear kinetic model of cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is used to describe the properties of the remnant of SN 1006. It is shown, that the theory fits the existing data in a satisfactory way within a set of parameters which is consistent with the idea that SN 1006 is a typical source of Galactic CR nucleons, although not necessarily of CR electrons. The adjusted parameters are those that are not very well determined by present theory or not directly amenable to astronomical observations. The calculated expansion law and the radio-, X-ray and gamma-ray emissions produced by the accelerated CRs in SN 1006 agree quite well with the observations. A rather large interior magnetic field B_d\approx 100 \muG is required to give a good fit for the radio and X-ray synchrotron emission. In the predicted TeV gamma-ray flux from SN 1006, the pi^0-decay gamma-rays, generated by the nuclear CR component, dominate over the inverse Compton (IC) gamma-rays, generated by the CR electrons in the cosmic microwave background. The predicted source morphology in high energy gamma-rays roughly corresponds to that of the synchrotron emission. The predicted integral gamma-ray flux F \propto e^-1 extends up to energies 100 TeV if CR diffusion is as strong as the Bohm limit. Only if the interior magnetic field is much lower in the SNR, B_d\approx 10 \muG, then the observed gamma-ray emission can be due to the accelerated electron component alone. In this case, not plausible physically in our view, the lowest permissible value of the electron to proton ratio is rather high, and the maximum individual energy and total energy content of accelerated nucleons so small, that SN 1006 can not be considered as a typical source of the nuclear Galactic CRs.

The observations, made with the Very Large Array, show the presence of a ring of atomic hydrogen that is associated with the outer portion of the ionized nebula. This ring is most probably gas ejected in the AGB phase that has been subsequently photodissociated by radiation from the central star. The H I emission spreads over about 50 km/s in radial velocity. The mass in H I is approximately 0.07 solar masses, about three times larger than the mass in molecular hydrogen and comparable with the mass in ionized hydrogen. Comment: 19 pages, 9 figures"
1732490,"Measurements of the flux and redshifts of Type Ia supernovae have provided persuasive evidence that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. If true, then in the context of standard FRW cosmology this suggests that the energy density of hte universe is dominated by ""dark energy"" -- a component with negative pressure of magnitude comparable to its energy density. To further investigate this phenomenon, more extensive surveys of supernovae are being planned. Given the likely timescales for completion, by the time data from these surveys are available some important cosmological parameters will be known to high precision from CMB measurements. Here we consider the impact of that foreknowledge on the design of supernova surveys. In particular we show that, despite greater opportunities to multiplex, purely from the point of view of statistical errors, a deep survey may not obviously be better than a shallow one."
1732491,"The advent of high signal-to-noise cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy experiments now allow detailed studies on the statistics related to temperature fluctuations. The existence of acoustic oscillations in the anisotropy power spectrum is now established with the clear detection of the first, and to a lesser confidence the second and the third, peak. Beyond the acoustic peak structure associated with CMB photon temperature fluctuations, we study the possibility for an observational detection of oscillations in the large scale structure (LSS) matter power spectrum due to baryons. We also suggest a new cosmological test using the angular power spectrum of dark matter halos, or clusters of galaxies detected via wide-field surveys of the large scale structure. The standard rulers of the proposed test involve overall shape of the matter power spectrum and baryon oscillation peaks in projection. The test allows a measurement of the angular diameter distance as a function of redshift, similar to the distance to the last scattering surface from the first acoustic peak in the temperature anisotropy power spectrum. The simultaneous detection of oscillations in both photons and baryons will provide a strong, and a necessary, confirmation of our understanding related to the physics during the recombination era. The proposed studies can be carried out with a combined analysis of CMB data from missions such as the MAP and the large scale structure data from missions such as the DUET."
1732492,"We explore the possibility that extrasolar planets might be found in the 1:1 mean-motion resonance. There are a variety of stable co-orbtial configurations, and we specifically examine three different versions of the 1:1 resonance. These include tadpole and horseshoe type orbits, as well as a more exotic configuration which occurs when one planet has a highly eccentric orbit while the other planet moves on a nearly circular orbit. We show that pairs of planets in 1:1 resonance yield characteristic radial velocity signatures which are not prone to the sin(i) degeneracy. Indeed, Keplerian fits to the radial velocities cannot reveal the presence of two planets in the 1:1 resonance. We discuss a dynamical fitting method for such systems, and illustrate its use with a simulated data set. Finally, we argue that hydrodynamical simulations and torqued three-body calculations indicate that 1:1 resonant pairs might readily form and migrate within protostellar disks.

1732493,"We calculate the structure function and intermittent exponent of the 1.) Keck data, which consists of 29 high resolution, high signal to noise ratio (S/N) QSO Ly$\alpha$ absorption spectra, and 2.)the Ly$\alpha$ forest simulation samples produced via the pseudo hydro scheme for the low density cold dark matter (LCDM) model and warm dark matter (WDM) model with particle mass $m_W=300, 600, 800$ and 1000 eV. These two measures detect not only non-gaussianities, but also the type of non-gaussianty in the the field. We find that, 1.) the structure functions of the simulation samples are significantly larger than that of Keck data on scales less than about 100 h$^{-1}$ kpc, 2.) the intermittent exponent of the simulation samples is more negative than that of Keck data on all redshifts considered, 3.) the order-dependence of the structure functions of simulation samples are closer to the intermittency of hierarchical clustering on all scales, while the Keck data are closer to a lognormal field on small scales. These differences are independent of noise and show that the intermittent evolution modeled by the pseudo-hydro simulation is substantially different from observations, even though they are in good agreement in terms of second and lower order statistics.

1732494,"The observed interstellar scintillation pattern of an intra-day variable radio source is influenced by its source structure. If the velocity of the interstellar medium responsible for the scattering is comparable to the earth's, the vector sum of these allows an observer to probe the scintillation pattern of a source in two dimensions and, in turn, to probe two-dimensional source structure on scales comparable to the angular scale of the scintillation pattern, typically $\sim 10 \mu$as for weak scattering. We review the theory on the extraction of an ``image'' from the scintillation properties of a source, and show how earth's orbital motion changes a source's observed scintillation properties during the course of a year. The imaging process, which we call Earth Orbit Synthesis, requires measurements of the statistical properties of the scintillations at epochs spread throughout the course of a year.

1732495,"The X-ray observations of SN 1987A over the previous 20 years have seen the emergence of soft X-rays from the interaction of the explosion shock wave with the ambient medium. This shock wave is now interacting strongly with the inner ring and might have passed already the highest density regions. The emission can be described by thermal models with two temperatures, with perhaps some but little change over time. Relative to the elemental abundances prevailing in the LMC the inner ring shows an overabundance of Si and S compared to the lighter elements and Fe, which suggests that the ring consists of highly processed matter dredged up in a binary merger event well before the explosion. The X-ray lightcurves between 0.5--2 keV and 3--10 keV differ significantly in slope, with the latter being much flatter but very similar to the radio light curve.

1732496,Motivated by a question of Krzysztof Oleszkiewicz we study a notion of weak tail domination of random vectors. We show that if the dominating random variable is sufficiently regular weak tail domination implies strong tail domination. In particular positive answer to Oleszkiewicz question would follow from the so-called Bernoulli conjecture.
1732497,"In the general context of computable metric spaces and computable measures we prove a kind of constructive Borel–Cantelli lemma: given a sequence (constructive in some way) of sets Ai with effectively summable measures, there are computable points which are not contained in infinitely many Ai.As a consequence of this we obtain the existence of computable points which follow the typical statistical behavior of a dynamical system (they satisfy the Birkhoff theorem) for a large class of systems, having computable invariant measure and a certain “logarithmic” speed of convergence of Birkhoff averages over Lipschitz observables. This is applied to uniformly hyperbolic systems, piecewise expanding maps, systems on the interval with an indifferent fixed point and it directly implies the existence of computable numbers which are normal with respect to any base."
1732498,"Elastic materials are governed by a constitutive law relating the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor Σ and the right Cauchy-Green strain tensor C=FTF. Isotropic elastic materials are the special cases for which the Cauchy stress tensor σ depends solely on the left Cauchy-Green strain tensor B=FFT. In this Note we revisit the following property of isotropic hyperelastic materials: if the constitutive law relating Σ and C is derivable from a potential ϕ, then σ and lnB are related by a constitutive law derived from the compound potential ϕ◯exp. We give a new and concise proof which is based on an explicit integral formula expressing the derivative of the exponential of a tensor."
1732499,"Let X=H/L be an irreducible real bounded symmetric domain realized as a real form in an Hermitian symmetric domain D=G/K. The intersection S of the Shilov boundary of D with X defines a distinguished subset of the topological boundary of X and is invariant under H. It can be realized as S=H/P for certain parabolic subgroup P of H. We study the spherical representations of H induced from P. We find formulas for the spherical functions in terms of the Macdonald hypergeometric function. This generalizes the earlier result of Faraut–Koranyi for Hermitian symmetric spaces D. We consider a class of H-invariant integral intertwining operators from the representations on L2(S) to the holomorphic representations of G restricted to H. We construct a new class of complementary series for the groups H=SO(n,m), SU(n,m) (with n−m>2) and Sp(n,m) (with n−m>1). We realize them as discrete components in the branching rule of the analytic continuation of the holomorphic discrete series of G=SU(n,m), SU(n,m)×SU(n,m) and SU(2n,2m) respectively."
1732500,"In the unification scheme, radio quasars and FR II radio galaxies come from the same parent population, but viewed at different angles. Based on the Comptonization models for the gamma-ray emission from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we estimate the number of radio quasars and FR II radio galaxies to be detected by the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) using the luminosity function (LF) of their parent population derived from the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) LF. We find that ~1200 radio quasars will be detected by GLAST, if the soft seed photons for Comptonization come from the regions outside the jets. We also consider the synchrotron self-Comptonization (SSC) model, and find it unlikely to be responsible for gamma-ray emission from radio quasars. We find that no FR II radio galaxies will be detected by GLAST. Our results show that most radio AGNs to be detected by GLAST will be FSRQs (~99 % for the external Comptonization model, EC model), while the remainder (~1 %) will be steep-spectrum radio quasars (SSRQs). This implies that FSRQs will still be good candidates for identifying gamma-ray AGNs even for the GLAST sources. The contribution of all radio quasars and FR II radio galaxies to the extragalactic gamma-ray background (EGRB) is calculated, which accounts for ~30 % of the EGRB.

1732502,"We present Giant Metrewave Radio Tele- scope (GMRT) HI 21cm emission images of the z = 0.009 damped Lyman-� (DLA) absorber to- wards the QSO HS 1543+5921. The DLA has been earlier identified as a low surface bright- ness galaxy SBS 1543+593 (Reimers & Hagen 1998, Bowen et al. 2001a) with small (� 400 pc) impact param- eter to the QSO line of sight. The extremely low redshift of the absorber allows us to make, for the first time, spa- tially resolved images of the 21cm emission; besides the HI mass, this also enables us to determine the velocity field of the galaxy and, hence, to estimate its dynamical mass. We obtain a total HI mass of � 1.4× 109 M⊙, con- siderably smaller than the value of M∗HI determined from blind 21cm emission surveys. This continues the trend of low HI mass in all low redshift DLAs for which HI emis- sion observations have been attempted. We also find that the QSO lies behind a region of low local HI column den- sity in the foreground galaxy. This is interesting in view of suggestions that DLA samples are biased against high HI column density systems. Finally, the dynamical mass of the galaxy is found to be Mdyn � 5 × 109 M⊙."
1732503,"We report on the detection of a rapidly variable narrow Fe K$\alpha$ line in Mkn 841. The source has been observed two times by XMM-Newton and simultaneously with BeppoSAX. The two observations, of about 10ks long each, were separated by $\sim$ 15 hours. The line flux reaches a maximum during the first observation and is significantly reduced in the second one. The continuum shape and flux, instead, keep roughly constant between the two pointings. Such rapid variability of a narrow (unresolved by the XMM-pn instrument) line has never been reported in the past. These results are not easily explained in the standard cold reflection model where the narrow line component is supposed to be produced far from the primary X-ray source (e.g. from the torus) and is thus not expected to vary rapidly. Different interpretations are discussed. Comment: Accepted in A&A Letter. 4 pages, 4 figures"
1732504,"We use a sample of 50 background X-ray sources (AGN) and candidate AGN in the field of the LMC observed with more than 50 counts in archival ROSAT PSPC observations to derive the observed log N-log S relation. We correct for the inhomogenous ROSAT PSPC exposure and the varying absorption due to the galactic and the LMC gas (for which we used an H I map derived from observations with the Parkes radio telescope). We compare the observed log N-log S relation with a theoretical log N-log S relation of the soft extragalactic X-ray background (SXRB) which comprises an AGN and a cluster of galaxy contribution. We find that the observed log N-log S has a deficiency with respect to the theoretical log N-log S. There are several factors which can account for such a deficiency: (1) incompleteness of the selected AGN and cluster of galaxies sample, (2) deviation of the theoretical log N-log S in the LMC field from the log N-log S derived from a large sample of AGN in several fields in the sky, (3) the existence of gas additional to the H I represented in the Parkes H I map of the LMC field, restricted to the high column ge 1021 cm-2 regime. We investigate the likely contribution of these effects and find that (1) a fraction (of at most ~ 30%) of the AGN and clusters of galaxies in the LMC field may not have been found in our analysis and may contribute to the observed deficiency. The existence of extended regions with hot diffuse gas and source crowding makes the detection of all AGN and clusters of galaxies very difficult. (2) We cannot exclude a deviation of the log N-log S in the field of the LMC from a mean theoretical log N-log S, especially the cluster of galaxy contribution which is of importance in the flux range we are comprising may show variations across the sky. (3) If LMC gas in addition to the H I represented in the Parkes H I map would be responsible for the deficiency and if this additional gas is restricted to the high column ge 1021 cm-2 regime, and assuming that the metallicity of the ISM of the LMC is -0.3 dex lower than the metallicity of the galactic ISM, then a factor of 1.9+/-3.31.6 at 90% confidence of additional gas would be required which, if purely molecular, would be equal to a molecular mass fraction of 63+/-2042%. Such a value would be larger than but within the uncertainties consistent with a molecular mass fraction of ~ 30% derived from CO observations for the high column regime of the LMC gas. From this analysis, it follows that some gas additional to the measured H I for the high column regime of the LMC gas is likely to be required to explain the observed log N - log S. But the amount of such additional gas is dependent on the completeness of our selected AGN and clusters of galaxies sample and on the assumptions made about the description of the log N - log S of the SXRB in the field of the LMC."
1732505,"In this work we propose a preliminary seismic investigation of $\delta$ Scuti stars in the Pleiades cluster, focusing on potential diagnostics of convection and core-overshooting. Taking into account the effect of fast rotation in the modelling, we compare observed frequencies for 4 $\delta$ Scuti stars with radial linear instability predictions. A satisfying agreement is reached between the predicted ranges of unstable modes and those derived from observations for ``low-mass'' stars ($\sim 1.55 M_{\odot}$). However, a strong disagreement is found for ``high-mass'' stars ($\sim 1.77 M_{\odot}$), whatever the mixing length $(\alpha)$ value. These results are compared with previous ones obtained for Praesepe."
1732506,"It is generally argued that most clusters of galaxies host cooling flows in which radiative cooling in the center causes a slow inflow. However, recent observations by Chandra and XMM conflict with the predicted cooling flow rates. It has been suggested that radio jets that are situated at the center of clusters of galaxies can assist in reducing the deposition of cold gas. Radio jets inflate cavities of hot radio plasma that rise through the cluster atmosphere and thus stir the intracluster medium. In this Letter, we investigate whether this scenario is consistent with the pronounced metallicity gradients that have been observed in the cores of clusters."
1732507,One of the most relevant problems in the extraction of scientifically useful information from wide field astronomical images (both photographic plates and CCD frames) is the recognition of the objects against a noisy background and their classification in unresolved (starlike) and resolved (galaxies) sources. In this paper we present a neural network based method capable to perform both tasks and discuss in detail the performance of object detection in a representative celestial field. The performance of our method is compared to that of other methodologies often used within the astronomical community
1732508,"I review detached binaries consisting of white dwarfs with either other white dwarfs or low mass main-sequence stars in tight orbits around them. Orbital periods have been measured for 15 white dwarf/white dwarf systems and 22 white dwarf/M dwarf systems. While small compared to the number of periods known for CVs (>300), I argue that each variety of detached system has a space density an order of magnitude higher that of CVs. While theory matches the observed distribution of orbital periods of the white dwarf/white dwarf binaries, it predicts white dwarfs of much lower mass than observed. Amongst both types of binary are clear examples of helium core white dwarfs, as opposed to the usual CO composition; similar systems must exist amongst the CVs. White dwarf/M dwarf binaries suffer from selection effects which diminish the numbers seen at long and short periods. They are useful for the study of irradiation; I discuss evidence to suggest that Balmer emission is broadened by optical depth effects to an extent which limits its usefulness for imaging the secondary stars in CVs."
1732509,"We determine simple analytical conditions for combined radiative and thermal equilibrium between the X-ray emitting plasma and the cold reprocessor in active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galactic black holes (GBHs). These conditions determine the pressure at the transition zone, which is not arbitrary in the static situation. The conditions for the static solution are derived analytically for different forms of plasma heating and for cooling provided by Compton cooling, bremsstrahlung and (optionally) advective cooling. We conclude that if Compton heating is the only heating mechanism, we always achieve static equilibrium between the phases. For constant volume heating and radiatively cooled plasma the static solution is never achieved and evaporation or condensation takes place. However, static solutions with no evaporation/condensation are found for radiative cooling supplemented with lateral advection. Similar results are obtained for a two-temperature plasma. In the case of a general prescription of mechanical heating (Q+h0PmT−s) of radiatively cooled one-temperature plasma, we find that a static solution is only possible when 0<s<3/2. Such conditions apply to all models, like disc/corona solutions, accretion-dominated advection flows (ADAFs) at their outer ADAF/disc boundary or cold clumps embedded in a hot medium. These models have to be reconsidered and supplemented either with an additional condition for the pressure at the transition zone or with an equation describing the mass exchange between the phases."

1732512,"We present preliminary results of an analysis into the effects of primordial voids on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show that an inflationary bubble model of void formation predicts excess power in the CMB angular power spectrum that peaks between 2000 < ℓ < 3000. Therefore, voids that exist on or close to the last scattering surface at the epoch of decoupling can contribute significantly to the apparent rise in power on these scales recently detected by the Cosmic Background Imager (CBI)."
1732513,"Point-source contamination in high-precision Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps severely affects the precision of cosmological parameter estimates. Among the methods that have been proposed for source detection, wavelet techniques based on ``optimal'' filters have been proposed.In this paper we show that these filters are in fact only restrictive cases of a more general class of matched filters that optimize signal-to-noise ratio and that have, in general, better source detection capabilities, especially for lower amplitude sources. These conclusions are confirmed by some numerical experiments. \keywords{Methods: data analysis -- Methods: statistical Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures"
1732514,"The composition of the outer 100 m of a neutron star sets the heat flux that flows outwards from the core. For an accreting neutron star in an X-ray transient, the thermal quiescent flux depends sensitively on the amount of hydrogen and helium remaining on the surface after an accretion outburst and on the composition of the underlying ashes of previous H/He burning. Because H/He has a higher thermal conductivity, a larger mass of H/He implies a shallower thermal gradient through the low density envelope and hence a higher effective temperature for a given core temperature. The mass of residual H and He varies from outburst to outburst, so the thermal quiescent flux is variable even though the core temperature is constant for timescales < 10 000 yr. Heavy elements settle from a H/He envelope in a few hours; we therefore model the quiescent envelope as two distinct layers, H/He over heavier elements, and treat the mass of H/He as a free parameter. We find that the emergent thermal quiescent flux can vary by a factor of 2 to 3 between different quiescent epochs. The variation is more pronounced at lower interior temperatures, making systems with low quiescent luminosities and frequent outbursts, such as SAX J1808.4-3658, ideal candidates from which to observe this effect. We compute, for different ash compositions, the interior temperatures of Cen X-4, Aql X-1, and SAX J1808.4-3658. In the case of Aql X-1, the inferred high interior temperature suggests that neutrino cooling contributes to the neutron star's thermal balance.

1732515,"We present broad-band 1.1, 1.6 and 2.2 micron images and a 2.37 micron narrow-band image of the inner 19"" of the nearby radio galaxy M87, obtained with the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The isophotes of the broad-band images are almost perfectly circular to within approximately 0.5"" (~ 50 pc) of the active nucleus, and an r**1/4 law provides a good fit to the galaxy profile to within the same distance. This result agrees with predictions that the nuclear supermassive black hole will produce a nearly spherical distribution of the surrounding stars within a galaxy crossing time. A difference image formed from the 1.6 micron image and a V-band image obtained with the HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 does not show any clear evidence of a physically thick dusty torus around the nucleus, consistent with its lack of strong thermal infrared emission. The images and associated colors also confirm that the regions beyond the nucleus do not contain strongly concentrated dust,in contrast to many other radio galaxies. In combination with other recent observations, these results indicate that M87 represents the dynamically evolved product of past galaxy mergers, and suggest that its nucleus is in the final stages of activity.

Broadband phase modeling was used to calibrate the varying dispersive effects of the ionosphere and remove the resulting phase errors from the phase-referenced VLBI data. The resulting parallaxes have a typical accuracy of 100 microarcseconds or better, yielding distances measurements as accurate as 2%. We also report new proper motion measurements of these pulsars, accurate to 0.4 mas per year or better."
1732518,"An empirical relationship, of particular interest for studies of high redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and quasars, between the masses of their central black-holes and rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) parameters measured in single-epoch AGN spectra is presented. This relationship is calibrated to recently measured reverberation masses of low-redshift AGNs and quasars. An empirical relationship between single-epoch rest-frame optical spectrophotometric measurements and the central masses is also presented. The UV relationship allows reasonable estimates of the central masses to be made of high-redshift AGNs and quasars for which these masses cannot be directly or easily measured by the techniques applicable to the lower luminosity, nearby AGNs. The central mass obtained by this method can be estimated to within a factor of ~3 for most objects. This is reasonable given the intrinsic uncertainty of a factor less than 2 in the primary methods used to measure the central masses of nearby inactive and active galaxies, namely resolved gas and stellar kinematics in the underlying host galaxy and reverberation-mapping techniques. The UV relationship holds good potential for being a powerful tool to study black-hole demographics at high redshift as well as to statistically study the fundamental properties of AGNs. The broad line region size - luminosity relationship is key to the calibrations presented here. The fact that its intrinsic scatter is also the main source of uncertainty in the calibrations stresses the need for better observational constraints to be placed on this relationship. The empirically calibrated relationships presented here will be applied to quasar samples in forthcoming work. Comment: 14 pages, plus 7 tables and 7 figures. To appear in ApJ, June 1, 2002"
1732519,"We report the discovery of two supernovae (SN 1999gw and SN 2001db) obtained within the framework of an infrared monitoring campaign of Luminous Infrared Galaxies, aimed at detecting obscured supernovae. SN 2001db, extinguished by Av~5.5 mag, is the first supernova discovered in the infrared which has received the spectroscopic confirmation. This result highlights the power of infrared monitoring in detecting obscured SNe and indicates that optical surveys are probably missing a significant fraction of SNe, especially in obscured systems such as starburst galaxies. The preliminary estimate of SN rate in LIRG galaxies is about an order of magnitude higher than that expected from optical surveys. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"
1732520,"In this paper, we analyse in detail the mass-accretion histories and structural properties of dark haloes in high-resolution N-body simulations. We model the density distribution in individual haloes using the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile. For a given halo, there is a tight correlation between its inner-scale radius rs and the mass within it, Ms, for all its main progenitors. Using this correlation, one can predict quite well the structural properties of a dark halo at any time in its history from its mass-accretion history, implying that the structure properties and the mass-accretion history are closely correlated. The predicted growing rate of concentration c with time tends to increase with decreasing mass-accretion rate. The build-up of dark haloes in cold dark matter (CDM) models generally consists of an early phase of fast accretion (where the halo mass Mh increases with time much faster than the expansion rate of the Universe) and a late phase of slow accretion (where Mh increases with time approximately as the expansion rate). These two phases are separated at a time when c∼ 4 and the typical binding energy of the halo is approximately equal to that of a singular isothermal sphere with the same circular velocity. Haloes in the two accretion phases show systematically different properties, for example, the circular velocity vh increases rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but remains almost constant in the slow accretion phase, the inner properties of a halo, such as rs and Ms increase rapidly with time in the fast accretion phase but change only slowly in the slow accretion phase, the inner circular velocity vs is approximately equal to vh in the fast accretion phase but is larger in the slow accretion phase. The potential well associated with a halo is built up mainly in the fast accretion phase, while a large amount of mass can be accreted in the slow accretion phase without changing the potential well significantly. We discuss our results in connection with the formation of dark haloes and galaxies in hierarchical models."
1732521,"The Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 camera has been used to image Andromeda III, a dwarf spheroidal companion (dSph) to M31. The resulting color-magnitude (c-m) diagrams reveal the morphology of the horizontal branch (HB) in this dwarf galaxy. We find that like Andromeda I and Andromeda II, and like most of the Galactic dSph companions, the HB morphology of And III is predominantly red, redder than that of both And I and And II despite And III having a lower mean metallicity. We interpret this red HB morphology as indicating that the bulk of the And III population is ~3 Gyr younger than the age of the majority of Galactic globular clusters. Nevertheless, the And III c-m diagram does reveal a few blue HB stars, and a number of RR Lyrae variables are also evident in the data. This indicates that And III does contain an `old' population of age comparable to that of the Galactic globular clusters. There is no evidence, however, for any young stars in And III despite a claimed association between this dSph and an HI cloud. As was the case for And II, but not And I, no radial gradient was detected in the And III HB morphology. And III is ~75 kpc from the center of M31, comparable to the Galactocentric distances of Sculptor and Draco. Comparison with standard globular cluster red giant branches indicates <[Fe/H]> = -1.88 +/-0.11, consistent with the absolute-magnitude - mean abundance relation followed by dSph galaxies. The same comparison yields an intrinsic abundance dispersion of sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.12, a low value compared to the Galactic dSphs of comparable luminosity to And III.

1732522,"We have surveyed known large-amplitude variables within 15' of the Galactic center in the SiO J=1-0 v=1 and 2 maser lines at 43 GHz, resulting in 79 detections and 58 non-detections. The detection rate of 58 percent is comparable to that obtained in Bulge IRAS source surveys. SiO lines were also detected from four other sources near the program objects. The SiO detection rate increases steeply with the period, particularly for stars with P>500 d, where it exceeds 80%. We found at a given period that the SiO detection rate is approximately double that for OH. These facts suggest that the large-amplitude variables in the Nuclear Disk region are AGB stars similar in their overall properties to the inner and outer bulge IRAS/SiO sources."
1732523,"Using the Moon to occult the Sun, the Clementine spacecraft used its navigation cameras to map the inner zodiacal light at optical wavelengths over elongations of 3≲ϵ≲30° from the Sun. This surface brightness map is then used to infer the spatial distribution of interplanetary dust over heliocentric distances of about 10 solar radii to the orbit of Venus. The averaged ecliptic surface brightness of the zodiacal light falls off as Z(ϵ)∝ϵ−2.45±0.05, which suggests that the dust cross-sectional density nominally falls off as σ(r)∝r−1.45±0.05. The interplanetary dust also has an albedo of a≃0.1 that is uncertain by a factor of ∼2. Asymmetries of ∼10% are seen in directions east–west and north–south of the Sun, and these may be due the giant planets' secular gravitational perturbations.We apply a simple model that attributes the zodiacal light as due to three dust populations having distinct inclination distributions, namely, dust from asteroids and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) having characteristic inclinations of i∼7°, dust from Halley-type comets having i∼33°, and an isotropic cloud of dust from Oort Cloud comets. The best-fitting scenario indicates that asteroids + JFCs are the source of about 45% of the optical dust cross section seen in the ecliptic at 1 AU but that at least 89% of the dust cross section enclosed by a 1-AU-radius sphere is of a cometary origin. Each population's radial density variations can also deviate somewhat from the nominal σ(r)∝r−1.45. When these results are extrapolated out to the asteroid belt, we find an upper limit on the mass of the light-reflecting asteroidal dust that is equivalent to a 12-km asteroid, and a similar extrapolation of the isotropic dust cloud out to Oort Cloud distances yields a mass equivalent to a 30-km comet, although the latter mass is uncertain by orders of magnitude."
1732524,The Pachmarhi array of Čerenkov telescopes consists of a distributed array of 25 telescopes that are used to sample the atmospheric Čerenkov photon showers. Each telescope consists of seven parabolic mirrors each viewed by a single photo-multiplier tube (PMT). Reconstruction of photon showers are carried out using fast timing information on the arrival of pulses at each PMT. The shower front is fitted to a plane and the direction of arrival of primary particle initiating the shower is obtained. The error in the determination of the arrival direction of the primary has been estimated using the split array method. It is found to be ∼2.4′ for primaries of energy>3 TeV. The dependence of the angular resolution on the separation between the telescopes and the number of detectors are also obtained from the data.
1732525,"Spin propagation in systems of one-dimensional interacting fermions at finite temperature is intrinsically diffusive. The spreading rate of a spin packet is controlled by a transport coefficient termed ""spin drag"" relaxation time $\tau_{\rm sd}$. In this paper we present both numerical and analytical calculations of $\tau_{\rm sd}$ for a two-component spin-polarized cold Fermi gas trapped inside a tight atomic waveguide. At low temperatures we find an activation law for $\tau_{\rm sd}$, in agreement with earlier calculations of Coulomb drag between slightly asymmetric quantum wires, but with a different and much stronger temperature dependence of the prefactor. Our results provide a fundamental input for microscopic time-dependent spin-density functional theory calculations of spin transport in 1D inhomogeneous systems of interacting fermions."
1732526,"We use deep (~120 ks) XMM-Newton data of the M87 halo to analyze its spatially resolved temperature structure and chemical composition. We focus particularly on the regions of enhanced X-ray brightness associated with the inner radio lobes, which are known not to be described very well by single-temperature spectral models. Compared to a simple two-temperature fit, we obtain a better and more physical description of the spectra using a model that involves a continuous range of temperatures in each spatial bin. The range of temperatures of the multiphase gas spans ~0.6-3.2 keV. Such a multiphase structure is only possible if thermal conduction is suppressed by magnetic fields. In the multi-temperature regions, we find a correlation between the amount of gas cooler than the surrounding X-ray plasma and the metallicity, and conclude that the cool gas is more metal-rich than the ambient halo. We estimate the average Fe abundance of the cool gas to ~2.2 solar. Our results thus point toward the key role of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in transporting heavy elements into the intracluster medium. The abundance ratios of O/Si/S/Fe in and outside the X-ray arms are similar, indicating that the dominant fraction of metals in the gas halo was uplifted by AGN outbursts relatively recently compared to the age of M87. Our estimate for the mass of the cool gas is 5e8 M_sun, which probably stems from a mixture of ICM, stellar mass loss, and Type Ia supernova products. ~30-110 Myr are required to produce the observed metals in the cool gas. Finally, we put upper limits on possible non-thermal X-ray emission from M87 and, combining it with the 90 cm radio maps, we put lower limits of around ~0.5-1.0 muG on the magnetic field strength.

1732527,"Recent observations of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636−53 with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer show, for the first time, a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillation (kHz QPO) peak separation that exceeds the neutron star spin frequency as inferred from burst oscillations. This strongly challenges the sonic-point beat-frequency model for the kHz QPOs found in low-mass X-ray binaries. We detect two simultaneous kHz QPOs with a frequency separation of 323.3 ± 4.3 Hz in an average Fourier power spectrum of observations obtained in 2001 September and 2002 January. The lower kHz QPO frequency varied between 644 and 769 Hz. In previous observations of this source the peak separation frequency was ∼250 Hz when the lower kHz QPO frequency was ∼900 Hz. Burst oscillations occur in 4U 1636−53 at ∼581 Hz and also possibly at half that frequency (290.5 Hz). This is the first source where the peak separation frequency is observed to change from less than (half) the burst oscillation frequency to more than that. This observation contradicts all previously formulated implementations of the sonic-point beat-frequency model except those where the disc in 4U 1636−53 switches from prograde to retrograde."
1732528,High spatial resolution (030) near-IR photometric observations using the adaptive optics of the Mount Wilson 100 inch (2.5 m) telescope and the Penn State IR Imager and Spectrograph have revealed faint companions to HD 190067 and HIP 13855. HD 190067B is found to be of mass 0.075–0.1 M with an age from 0.5 Gyr to a few gigayears. HIP 13855B is a low-mass star (age 100–500 Myr) of mass between 0.1 and 0.2 M. Further near-IR spectroscopic observations will be necessary to classify their spectral types precisely.

1732530,"Theoretical differential oscillator strengths related to monochromatic opacity due to K- and L-shell absorption from oxygen and iron ions are directly compared with the Chandra and Xmm-Newton spectra of Seyfert~1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15. We compute the highly resolved continuum with resonances due to O I - VI and Fe XVI. It is found that the KLn (n --> infty) resonance series limits in O VI, and the lowest LMM resonance in Fe XVI, lie at the prominent 17.5 A break in the observed spectra. We also calculate and identify, for the first time, the observed gap in spectral flux at 22-23 A in the Chandra spectra due to K --> L resonant absorption features from all O-ions O I - VI, potentially leading to abundance determination of several or all ionization stages; similar signature gaps may be predicted due to other elements. The precise atomic parameters are computed in the relativistic close coupling approximation using the Breit-Pauli R-matrix method. The new X-ray opacities might possibly distinguish between models of a dusty warm absorber, and/or gravitational redshift and broadening due to a massive black hole in MCG--6-30-15."
1732531,"We report on a clear spectral state transition of the neutron star low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1705-44 observed by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer. In the X-ray color-color diagram (CCD), the source, classified as an atoll, samples the upper parts of a Z, starting from and returning to the left bottom of the Z. We follow the path of 4U 1705-44 on its CCD, model its broadband X-ray/hard X-ray spectrum, and compute the Fourier power density spectrum of its X-ray variability. The energy spectrum can be described as the sum of a dominating Comptonized component, a blackbody, and a 6.4 keV iron line. During most observations, 4U 1705-44 displays strong band-limited noise, with an integrated fractional rms varying from ~10% to ~20%. The spectral transitions of 4U 1705-44 are shown to be primarily associated with changes in the temperature of the Comptonizing electrons. During the soft-to-hard transition, the source luminosity decreased from ~2.1 to ~0.7×1037 ergs s-1, whereas the hard-to-soft transition took place at higher luminosities between ~2.5 and ~3.1×1037 ergs s-1. In the hard state (top branch of the Z), the source evolves from left to right on the CCD, while its luminosity smoothly increases. Along this branch, the increase in the soft color is related to a smooth increase in the blackbody temperature, while the electron temperature remained remarkably constant (~13 keV). Our observations can be interpreted in the framework of a model made of a truncated accretion disk of varying inner radius and an inner flow merging smoothly with the neutron star boundary layer. The spectral evolution could be driven by changes in the truncation radius of the disk; e.g., the soft-to-hard transition could be caused by the disk moving outward. If this model is correct, then our data show that the disk truncation radius is not set by the instantaneous mass accretion rate, as derived from the source bolometric luminosity. Comparing the power density spectra of 4U 1705-44 and Z sources when they occupy similar branches of the Z, we show that the most significant difference is on the diagonal branch, on which the power density spectra of 4U 1705-44 remain similar to the ones measured on the top branch of the Z (hard state)."
1732532,"We have obtained high-resolution ($R\sim 90000$) spectra of the carbon-and s-process-element-rich, very metal-poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]} =-2.7$) subgiant LP 625-44, as well as those of HD 140283 (a metal-poor subgiant with normal abundance ratio) for a comparison, with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the Subaru Telescope for detailed abundance study. The excess of oxygen in LP 625-44 seems to be remarkable (perhaps by nearly a factor 10) compared with that of HD 140283 derived from the O i triplet around 7770 Å, though the oxygen abundance derived from these lines is uncertain. The Na enhancement in LP 625-44 is by about a factor 50, suggesting hydrogen burning in the ${{22\atop} \mathrm{Ne}}$-rich layer in an asymptotic giant branch star which produced the abundance pattern of this object. In our new spectrum of LP 625-44, the Pb i $\lambda$3683 Å line has been detected, confirming the Pb abundance [$\log \epsilon \mathrm{(Pb)} \sim 1.9$] derived from the Pb i $\lambda$4057 Å line by previous work. The abundance ratio of s-process elements at the second peak (e.g., La, Ce, and Nd) to that at the third peak (Pb) in LP 625-44 is significantly higher (by a factor 5) than that in other three s-process element-rich objects recently studied by van Eck et al. Recent theoretical studies have modeled s-process nucleosynthesis in the radiative layer of asymptotic giant branch stars in the inter-pulse phase. The above results mean that these processes produced a large scatter in the abundance ratios, or different processes (e.g., s-process nucleosynthesis during thermal pulses) contributed to heavy elements in the early Galaxy."
1732533,"The calculations of the ratios of the Helium-like ion X-ray lines from C V to Si XIII are revisited in order to apply the results to density, temperature and ionization process diagnostics of data from high-resolution spectroscopy of the new generation of X-ray satellites: Chandra and XMM-Newton. Comparing to earlier computations, Porquet & Dubau (2000), the best experimental values are used for radiative transition probabilities. The influence of an external radiation field (photo-excitation), the contribution from unresolved dielectronic satellite lines and the optical depth are taken into account. These diagnostics could be applied to collision-dominated plasmas (e.g., stellar coronae), photo-ionized plasmas (e.g., ``Warm Absorber'' in AGNs), and transient plasmas (e.g., SNRs)."
1732534,"If a source star is gravitationally microlensed by a multiple lens system, the resulting light curve can have significant deviations from the standard form of a single lens event. The chance to produce significant deviations becomes important when the separations between the component lenses are equivalent to the combined angular Einstein ring radius of the system. For multiple lens systems composed of more than two lenses, however, this condition is difficult to meet because the orbits of such systems are unstable. Even if events are caused by a multiple lens system with stable orbits where a pair of lenses are closely located and the other component (third body) has a wide separation from the pair, photometrically identifying the lens multiplicity will be difficult because the event will be identified either by a binary lens event caused by the close pair lenses or a single lens event caused by the third body. In this paper, we show that if a seemingly binary lens event is astrometrically followed up by using future high precision interferometers, the existence of an additional third body can be identified via a repeating event. We show that the signatures of third bodies can be unambiguously identified from the characteristic distortions they make in the centroid shift trajectories. We also show that due to the long range astrometric effect of third bodies, the detection efficiency will be considerable even for third bodies with large separations from their close lens pairs.

1732535,"We investigate the dynamical state of superclusters in Λ cold dark matter cosmological models, where the density parameter Ω0= 0.2–0.4 and σ8 (the rms fluctuation on the 8 h−1 Mpc scale) is 0.7–0.9. To study the non-linear regime, we use N-body simulations. We define superclusters as maxima of the density field smoothed on the scale R= 10 h−1 Mpc. Smaller superclusters defined by the density field smoothed on the scale R= 5 h−1 Mpc are also investigated. We find the relations between the radially averaged peculiar velocity and the density contrast in the superclusters for different cosmological models. These relations can be used to estimate the dynamical state of a supercluster on the basis of its density contrast. In the simulations studied, all the superclusters defined with the 10 h−1 Mpc smoothing are expanding by the present epoch. Only a small fraction of the superclusters defined with R= 5 h−1 Mpc have already reached their turnaround radius and these superclusters have started to collapse. In the model with Ω0= 0.3 and σ8= 0.9, the number density of objects that have started to collapse is 5 × 10−6h3 Mpc−3. The results for superclusters in the N-body simulations are compared with the spherical collapse model. We find that the radial peculiar velocities in N-body simulations are systematically smaller than those predicted by the spherical collapse model (∼25 per cent for the R= 5 h−1 Mpc superclusters)."
1732536,"For beam energies from SPS to RHIC, the transverse energy per charged particle, $E_T/N_{\textrm{ch}}$, saturates at a value of approximately 0.8 GeV. A direct connection between this value and the freeze-out criterium $E/N \approx 1$ GeV for the primordial energy and particle number in the hadronic resonance gas model is established."
1732537,"The pulsar magnetosphere contains a strongly magnetized, relativistic plasma. We need to understand the physics of that plasma if we want to connect the data to the models. Our group in Socorro is mixing theory and observations in order to study the radio-loud pulsar plasma. In this paper we report on several aspects of our current work."
1732538,"We present results of an analysis of a UV image in the direction of Ophiuchus, obtained with the FAUST instrument. The image contains 228 UV sources. Most of these were identified as normal early-type stars through correlations with cataloged objects. For the first time in this project we identified UV sources as such stars by selecting suitable candidates in crowded fields as the bluest objects in color-color diagrams using observations from the Wise Observatory. These candidates were then studied using low-resolution spectroscopy, which allowed the determination of spectral types to an accuracy of about one-half class, for 60 stars. Synthetic photometry of spectral data was performed in order to predict the expected UV emission, on the basis of the photometric information. These results were used along with the Hipparcos/Tycho information, to search for sub-luminous stars. The comparison of the predicted emission with the FAUST measured magnitudes allowed us to select twelve stars as highly-probable evolved hot stars. High signal-to-noise spectra were obtained for nine of these stars and Balmer line profiles were compared with the prediction of atmosphere models and with the spectrum of real stellar atmospheres. Among the nine candidates, six are classified as previously unrecognized sdB stars and two as white dwarfs. Our result indicates that indeed more bright subluminous stars are still unrecognized in the existing samples."
1732539,"The kinematics and physical conditions of the bipolar planetary nebula M 2-48 are analysed from high and low dispersion long-slit spectra. Previous CCD narrow-band optical observations have suggested that this nebula is mainly formed by a pair of symmetric bow-shocks, an off-center semi-circular shell, and an internal bipolar structure. The bipolar outflow has a complex structure, characterised by a series of shocked regions located between the bright core and the polar tips. There is an apparent kinematic discontinuity between the bright bipolar core and the outer regions. The fragmented ring around the bright bipolar region presents a low expansion velocity and could be associated to ejection in the AGB-PN transition phase, although its nature remains unclear. The chemical abundances of the central region are derived, showing that M 2-48 is a Type I planetary nebula (PN)."
1732540,"We report photometry of 1RXS J232953.9+062814, a recently discovered dwarf nova with a remarkably short 64.2-minute orbital period. In quiescence, the star's light curve is that of a double sinusoid, arising from the ""ellipsoidal"" distortion of the Roche-lobe-filling secondary. During superoutburst, common superhumps develop with a period 3-4% longer than P_orb. This indicates a mass ratio M_2/M_1=0.19+-0.02, a surprisingly large value in so compact a binary. This implies that the secondary star has a density 2-3 times higher than that of other short-period dwarf novae, suggesting a secondary enriched by H-burning prior to the common-envelope phase of evolution. We estimate i=50+-5 deg, M_1=0.63 (+0.12, -0.09) M_sol, M_2=0.12 (+0.03, -0.02) M_sol, R_2=0.121 (+0.010, -0.007) R_sol, and a distance to the binary of 180+-40 pc.

1732541,"Using the theoretical models of the QSO formation, we can reproduce optical QSO luminosity functions (LFs) at high redshifts (z > 2.2). Two different models can reproduce LFs successfully, though the lifetime of QSOs, t_Q, and the relation between the black hole mass and the host halo mass are different each other; t_Q = 10^6yr, in one model, t_Q > 10^7yr, in other models. Here, we propose a method to break this degeneracy. We calculate the mass function of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z=2.5, and compare the result with the current mass function obtained by Salucci et al.(1999). In the shorter lifetime model, the mass function at z=2.5 exceeds that of z=0.0 by one order of magnitude, then it should be ruled out. We conclude that the lifetime is at least t_Q > 10^7yr. Next, we examine the difference of the formation epoch of SMBHs existing at z=3.0 for each model under the model assumptions. We simply discuss the difference of formation epoch as another possible model-discriminator. Comment: 18 pages, including 6 postscript figures, accepted for publication on ApJ"
1732542,"The ionization degree x(e)(=n(e)/n(H2), with n(e) and n(H2) the electron and H2 number density, respectively) plays a key role in the chemical and dynamical evolution of interstellar clouds. Gas-phase ion–molecule reactions are major chemical routes to the formation of interstellar molecules. The time scale for ambipolar diffusion of neutrals across field lines is proportional to the ionization degree, which therefore is a crucial parameter in determining the initial conditions which precede the collapse to form a star. A direct measure of x(e) is hindered by the difficulty of observing H3+ and H3O+, two of the most abundant molecular ions, and atomic species with low ionization potentials, such as atomic carbon and metals, which may be the main repositories of positive charge.Deuterium fractionation in molecular ions, in particular HCO+, has been extensively used to estimate the degree of ionization in molecular clouds. This paper reviews recent work on ionization degree in homogeneous clouds. We will show that the N(DCO+)/N(HCO+) column density ratio furnishes a measurement of x(e) only in regions where CO is not significantly depleted, thus in the outer skirts of dense cloud cores. To probe x(e) deep inside the clouds, one has to gauge deuterium enhancement in molecular ions with parent species not affected by depletion (e.g. N2H+ ), and rely on chemical models which take into account the cloud density structure. Unlike N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), the N(N2D+)/N(N2H+) column density ratio is predicted to considerably increase with core evolution (and/or the amount of CO depletion), reaching large values (≳0.2) in cloud cores on the verge of forming a star."
1732543,"RX J1914.4+2456 is a candidate double-degenerate binary (AM CVn) with a putative 569 s orbital period. If this identification is correct, then it has one of the shortest binary orbital periods known, and gravitational radiation should drive the orbital evolution and mass transfer if the binary is semi-detached. Here we report the results of a coherent timing study of the archival ROSAT and ASCA data for RX J1914.4+2456. We performed a phase coherent timing analysis using all five ROSAT observations spanning a 4.6 year period. We demonstrate that all the data can be phase connected, and we show evidence that the 1.756 mHz orbital frequency is increasing at a rate of 8 +- 3 e-18 Hz/s, consistent with the expected loss of angular momentum from the binary system via gravitational radiation. In addition to providing evidence for the emission of gravitational waves, our measurement of the orbital decay constrains models for the X-ray emission and the nature of the secondary. If stable mass accretion drives the X-ray flux, then orbital decay is inconsistent with a degenerate donor. A helium burning dwarf is compatible if indeed such systems can have periods as short as that of RX J1914.4+2456, an open theoretical question. Our measurement is consistent with the unipolar induction model of Wu et al. which does not require accretion to drive the X-ray flux. We discuss how future timing measurements of RX J1914.4+2456 (and systems like it) with for example, Chandra and XMM-Newton, can provide a unique probe of the interaction between mass loss and gravitational radiation. We also discuss the importance of such measurements in the context of gravitational wave detection from space, such as is expected in the future with the LISA mission.

1732544,"We present the SAURON project, which is aimed at studying the morphology, two-dimensional kinematics and stellar populations of a representative sample of elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges. SAURON, a dedicated integral-field spectrograph that is optimized for wide-field observations and has high throughput, was built in Lyon and is now operated at the WHT 4.2m telescope. At present, we have observed approximately two thirds of the seventy-two sample galaxies with SAURON. A comparison with published long-slit measurements demonstrates that the SAURON-data is of equal or better quality, and provides full two-dimensional coverage. The velocity and velocity dispersion fields exhibit a large variety of morphologies: from simple rotating systems to cylindrical, disky and triaxial velocity fields, bars and decoupled cores. Most of these kinematical signatures do not have counterparts in the light distribution. While some galaxies are consistent with axisymmetry, most are more complex systems than assumed previously. This suggests that the kinematical properties of nearby E/S0 galaxies do not agree with the often assumed simplistic two-family model, in which the giant non-rotating triaxial ellipticals are opposed to the fast-rotating axisymmetric faint ellipticals and S0s."
1732545,"We determine the extinction curve in the zl = 0.83 lens galaxy of the gravitational lens SBS 0909+532 from the wavelength dependence of the flux ratio between the lensed quasar images (zs = 1.38) from 3400 to 9200 Å. It is the first measurement of an extinction curve at a cosmological distance of comparable quality to those obtained within the Galaxy. The extinction curve has a strong 2175 Å feature, a noteworthy fact because it has been weak or nonexistent in most estimates of extinction curves outside the Galaxy. The extinction curve is fitted well by a standard RV = 2.1 ± 0.9 Galactic extinction curve. If we assume standard Galactic extinction laws, the estimated dust redshift of z = 0.88 ± 0.02 is in good agreement with the spectroscopic redshift of the lens galaxy. The widespread assumption that SMC extinction curves are more appropriate models for cosmological dust may be incorrect."
1732546,"Recently, the intrinsic sampling method has been developed in order to obtain, from molecular simulations, the intrinsic structure of the liquid-vapor interface that is presupposed in the classical capillary wave theory. Our purpose here is to study dynamical processes at the liquid-vapor interface, since this method allows tracking down and analyzing the movement of surface molecules, thus providing, with great accuracy, dynamical information on molecules that are ""at"" the interface. We present results for the coefficients for diffusion parallel and perpendicular to the liquid-vapor interface of the Lennard-Jones fluid, as well as other time and length parameters that characterize the diffusion process in this system. We also obtain statistics of permanence and residence time. The generality of our results is tested by varying the system size and the temperature; for the latter case, an existing model for alkali metals is also considered. Our main conclusion is that, even if diffusion coefficients can still be computed, the turnover processes, by which molecules enter and leave the intrinsic surface, are as important as diffusion. For example, the typical time required for a molecule to traverse a molecular diameter is very similar to its residence time at the surface."
1732547,"Micron-sized objects confined in thin liquid films interact through forces mediated by the deformed liquid-air interface. These capillary interactions provide a powerful driving mechanism for the self-assembly of ordered structures such as photonic materials or protein crystals. We demonstrate how optical micro-manipulation allows the direct measurement of capillary interactions between mesoscopic objects. The force falls off as an inverse power law in particles separation. We derive and validate an explicit expression for this exponent whose magnitude is mainly governed by particle size. For micron-sized objects we found an exponent close to, but smaller than 1, making capillary interactions a unique example of strong and very long ranged forces in the mesoscopic world."

1732549,"We present the analysis of a 38.4 ks and a 23.6 ks observation of the core of the Pleiades open cluster. The Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory detected 99 X-ray sources in a 17'X17' region, including 18 of 23 Pleiades members. Five candidate Pleiades members have also been detected, confirming their cluster membership. Fifty-seven sources have no optical or near-infrared counterparts to limiting magnitudes V=22.5 and J=14.5. The unidentified X-ray sources are probably background AGN and not stars. The Chandra field of view contains seven intermediate mass cluster members. Five of these, HII 980 (B6 + G), HII 956 (A7 + F6), HII 1284 (A9 + K), HII 1338 (F3 + F6), and HII 1122 (F4 + K), are detected in this study. All but HII 1284 have high X-ray luminosity and soft X-ray spectra. HII 1284 has X-ray properties comparable to non-flaring K-type stars. Since all five stars are visual or spectroscopic binaries with X-ray properties similar to F-G stars, the late-type binary companions are probably producing the observed coronal X-ray emission. Strengthening this conclusion is the nondetection by Chandra of two A stars, HII 1362 (A7, no known companion) and HII 1375 (A0 + A SB) with X-ray luminosity upper limits 27-54 times smaller than HII 980 and HII 956, the B6-A7 stars with cooler companions. Despite the low number statistics, the Chandra data appear to confirm the expectation that late-B and A stars are not strong intrinsic X-ray sources. The ACIS spectra and hardness ratios suggest a gradual increase in coronal temperature with decreasing mass from F4 to K. M stars appear to have somewhat cooler coronae than active K stars.

1732550,"X-ray transients provide unique opportunity to probe accretion regimes of at a vastly different accretion rates. We analyze a collection of the RXTE observations (Galactic Center scans, ASM monitoring and a pointed observation) of enigmatic transient source high mass X-ray binary V4641 Sgr and argue that they broadly support the hypothesis that giant September 1999 outburst was associated with an episode of super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole. During the outburst an extended optically thick envelope/outflow has been formed around the source making the observational appearance of V4641 Sgr in many aspects very similar to that of SS433. These results suggest that objects like V4641 Sgr and SS433 indeed represent the class of objects accreting matter at a rate comparable or above Eddington value and the formation of an envelope/outflow is a generic characteristic of supercritical accretion. When the accretion rate decreased the envelope vanished and the source short term variability and spectral properties started to resemble those of other galactic black hole candidates accreting at a rate well below the Eddington value. Interestingly that during this phase the source spectrum was very similar to the Cygnus X-1 spectrum in the low state inspite of more than order of magnitude larger X-ray luminosity.

1732551,"The bulk of the molecular line emission in the double barred galaxy NGC4303 as observed in its CO(1-0) line with the OVRO mm-interferometer comes from two straight gas lanes which run north-south along the leading sides of the large-scale primary bar. Inside a radius of ~ 400 pc the molecular gas forms a spiral pattern which, for the northern arm, can be traced to the nucleus. Comparison of the OVRO and archival HST data with dynamical models of gas flow in the inner kiloparsec of single- and double-barred galaxies shows that the observed global properties of the molecular gas are in agreement with models for the gas flow in a strong, large-scale bar, and the two-arm spiral structure seen in CO in the inner kiloparsec can already be explained by a density wave initiated by the potential of that bar. Only a weak correlation between the molecular gas distribution and the extinction seen in the HST V-H map is found in the inner 400 pc of NGC4303: The innermost part of one arm of the nuclear CO spiral correlates with a weak dust filament in the color map, while the overall dust distribution follows a ring or single-arm spiral pattern well correlated with the UV continuum. This complicated nuclear geometry of the stellar and gaseous components allows for two scenarios: (A) A self-gravitating m=1 mode is present forming the spiral structure seen in the UV continuum. In this case the gas kinematics would be unaffected by the small (~ 4'') inner bar. (B) The UV continuum traces a complete ring which is heavily extincted north of the nucleus. Such a ring forms in hydrodynamic models of double bars, but the models cannot account for the UV emission observed on the leading side of the inner bar. (abridged)"
1732552,"We present an interferometric measurement of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) at 1 cm for the galaxy cluster Abell 2163. We combine this data point with previous measurements at 1.1, 1.4, and 2.1 mm from the SuZIE experiment to construct the most complete SZE spectrum to date. The intensity in four wavelength bands is fit to determine the central Compton y-parameter (y_c) and the peculiar velocity (v_p) for this cluster. Our results are y_c=3.56(+0.41/-0.41)(+0.27/-0.19) x 10^-4 and v_p=410(+1030/-850)(+460/-440) km/s where we list statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively, at 68% confidence. These results include corrections for contamination by Galactic dust emission. We find less contamination by dust emission than previously reported. The dust emission is distributed over much larger angular scales than the cluster signal and contributes little to the measured signal when the details of the SZE observing strategy are taken into account."
1732553,"We report here a study of the long term properties of Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPO) in an unusual accreting X-ray pulsar, 4U 1626--67. This is a unique accretion powered X-ray pulsar in which we have found the QPOs to be present during all sufficiently long X-ray observations with a wide range of X-ray observatories. In the present spin-down era of this source, the QPO central frequency is found to be decreasing. In the earlier spin-up era of this source, there are only two reports of QPO detections, in 1983 with EXOSAT and 1988 with GINGA with an increasing trend. The QPO frequency evolution in 4U 1626--67 during the last 22 years changed from a positive to a negative trend, somewhat coincident with the torque reversal in this source. In the accretion powered X-ray pulsars, the QPO frequency is directly related to the inner radius of the accretion disk, as per Keplerian Frequency Model (KFM) and Beat Frequency Model (BFM). A gradual depletion of accretion disk is reported earlier from the X-ray spectral, flux and pulse profile measurements. The present QPO frequency evolution study shows that X-ray flux and mass accretion rate may not change by the same factor, hence the simple KFM and BFM are not able to explain the QPO evolution in this source. This is the only X-ray pulsar to show persistent QPOs and is also the first accreting X-ray pulsar in which the QPO history is reported for a long time scale relating it with the long term evolution of the accretion disk.

1732554,"Scattering of light by a random stack of dielectric layers represents a one-dimensional scattering problem, where the scattered field is a three-dimensional vector field. We investigate the dependence of the scattering properties (band gaps and Anderson localization) on the wavelength, strength of randomness and relative angle of the incident wave. There is a characteristic angular dependence of Anderson localization for wavelengths close to the thickness of the layers. In particular, the localization length varies non-monotonously with the angle. In contrast to Anderson localization, absorptive layers do not have this characteristic angular dependence."
1732555,"We present a comprehensive analysis of all observations of Cyg X-1 by the Compton Gamma Ray Observa-tory Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE; 20–300 keV) and by the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer all-sky monitor (ASM; 1.5–12 keV) until 2002 June, including $1200 days of simultaneous data. We find a number of correlations between fluxes and hardnesses in different energy bands. In the hard (low) spectral state, there is a negative correlation between the ASM 1.5–12 keV flux and the hardness at any energy. In the soft (high) spectral state, the ASM flux is positively correlated with the ASM hardness but uncorrelated with the BATSE hardness. In both spectral states, the BATSE hardness correlates with the flux above 100 keV, while it shows no correlation with the 20–100 keV flux. At the same time, there is clear correlation between the BATSE fluxes below and above 100 keV. In the hard state, most of the variability can be explained by softening the overall spectrum with a pivot at $50 keV. There is also another, independent variability pattern of lower amplitude where the spectral shape does not change when the luminosity changes. In the soft state, the variability is mostly caused by a variable hard (Comptonized) spectral component of a constant shape superposed on a constant soft blackbody component. These variability patterns are in agreement with the dependencies of the rms variability on the photon energy in the two states. We also study in detail recent soft states from late 2000 until 2002. The last of them has lasted thus far for more than 200 days. Their spectra are generally harder in the 1.5–5 keV band and similar or softer in the 3–12 keV band than the spectra of the 1996 soft state, whereas the rms variability is stronger in all the ASM bands. On the other hand, the 1994 soft state transition observed by BATSE appears very similar to the 1996 one. We interpret the variability patterns in terms of theoretical Comptonization models. In the hard state, the variability appears to be driven mostly by changing flux in seed photons Comptonized in a hot thermal plasma cloud with an approximately constant power supply. In the soft state, the variability is consistent with flares of hybrid, thermal/nonthermal, plasma with variable power above a stable cold disk. The spectral and timing differences between the 1996 and 2000– 2002 soft states are explained by a decrease of the color disk temperature. Also, on the basis of broadband pointed observations simultaneous with those of the ASM and BATSE, we find the intrinsic bolometric lumi-nosity increases by a factor of $3–4 from the hard state to the soft one, which supports models of the state transition based on a change of the accretion rate."
1732556,"Kinetic energy stored in interstellar medium (ISM) bulk/turbulent motions is a crucial ingredient in properly describing most properties of observed galaxies. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate how this energy is injected by supernovae and dissipated via cloud collisions, and derive the corresponding ISM velocity probability distribution function (PDF). The functional form of the PDF for the modulus of the velocity dispersion is The power-law index of the PDF depends only on the value of the average cloud collision elasticity 〈ε〉 as β= 2 exp(〈ε〉− 1). If β and the gas velocity dispersion σ are known, the specific kinetic energy dissipated by collisions is found to be ∝σ2 ln(2/β)/(β− 0.947); in steady state, this is equal to the energy input from supernovae (SNe). We predict that in a multiphase, low-metallicity (Z≈ 5 × 10−3Z⊙) ISM the PDF should be close to a Maxwellian (β= 2) with velocity dispersion σ≳ 11 km s−1; in more metal rich systems (Z≳ 5 × 10−2Z⊙), on the other hand, we expect to observe almost exponential PDFs. This is in good agreement with a number of observations that we review and might explain the different star formation modes seen in dwarfs and spiral galaxies."
1732557,"Calculations are performed to demonstrate the deviations from Gaussian that occur in the spectral line profiles of a linear maser as a result of the amplification process. Near-Gaussian profiles are presented for bright, interstellar 22 GHz water masers obtained from high resolution Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of W3 IRS 5. For the profiles to be so close to Gaussian, the calculations indicate that these masers must originate in quite hot gas with temperatures greater than 1200 K -- a conclusion that is supportive of C-type shocks as the origin of these masers. In addition, the degree of saturation of these masers must be less than approximately one-third, from which it follows that the beaming angles are less than about 10^{-4} ster and the actual luminosities are modest. If spectral profiles that are as close to Gaussian as the profiles presented in this initial investigation are found to occur widely, they can be valuable diagnostics for the environments of astrophysical masers.

1732558,"Studies of weak gravitational lensing by large-scale structures require the measurement of the distortions introduced to the shapes of distant galaxies at the few percent level by anisotropic light deflection along the line of sight. In order to detect this signal on 1'-10' scales in a particular field, accurate measurements of correlations between the shapes of order 103-104 galaxies are required. This large-scale averaging is required to accommodate the unknown intrinsic shapes of the background galaxies, even with careful removal of systematic effects. Here an alternative is discussed. If it is possible to measure accurately the detailed dynamical structure of the background galaxies, in particular rotating disks, then it should be possible to measure directly the cosmic shear distortion since it generally leads to a non-self-consistent rotation curve. Narrow spectral lines and an excellent two-dimensional spatial resolution are required. The ideal lines are CO rotational transitions, and the ideal telescope is the Atacama Large Millimeter Array."
1732559,"We show that the gaseous halos of collapsed objects introduce a substantial cumulative opacity to ionizing radiation, even after the smoothly distributed hydrogen in the intergalactic medium has been fully reionized. This opacity causes a delay of around unity in redshift between the time of the overlap of ionized bubbles in the intergalactic medium and the lifting of complete Gunn-Peterson Lyman alpha absorption. The minihalos responsible for this screening effect are not resolved by existing numerical simulations of reionization. Comment: 24 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ"
1732560,"We present new, high-sensitivity submillimeter observations toward 55 Cancri, a nearby G8 star with one, or possibly two, known planetary companion(s). Our 850 μm map, obtained with the Submillimeter Common-User Bolometric Array on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, shows three peaks of emission at the 2.5 mJy level in the vicinity of the star's position. However, the observed peaks are 25''-40'' away from the star, and a deep R-band optical image reveals faint point sources that coincide with two of the submillimeter peaks. Thus, we do not find evidence of dust emission spatially associated with 55 Cancri. The excess 60 μm emission detected with the Infrared Space Observatory may originate from one or more of the 850 μm peaks that we attribute to background sources. Our new results, together with the Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS coronagraphic images in the near-infrared, place stringent limits on the amount of dust in this planetary system and argue against the existence of a detectable circumstellar dust disk around 55 Cnc."
1732561,"We present radio observations of the afterglow of the bright γ-ray burst GRB 980329 made between 1 month and several years after the burst, a reanalysis of previously published submillimeter data, and late-time optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the host galaxy. From the absence of a spectral break in the optical/NIR colors of the host galaxy, we exclude the earlier suggestion that GRB 980329 lies at a redshift of z 5. We combine our data with the numerous multiwavelength observations of the early afterglow, fit a comprehensive afterglow model to the entire broadband data set, and derive fundamental physical parameters of the blast wave and its host environment. Models for which the ejecta expand isotropically require both a high circumburst density and extreme radiative losses from the shock. No low-density model (n 10 cm-3) fits the data. A burst with a total energy of ~1051 ergs, with the ejecta narrowly collimated to an opening angle of a few degrees, driven into a surrounding medium with density of ~20 cm-3, provides a satisfactory fit to the light curves over a range of redshifts."
1732562,"We obtained EUV photometry, optical spectroscopy, and multi-color optical photometry for WX Cet during its 1998 November superoutburst. WX Cet is only the second short-period, low mass transfer CV (TOAD) to ever be observed in the EUV. Our determined superhump period is consistent with that found by Kato et al. (0.059 d) and we confirm that superhumps are grey in the optical. The optical spectra provide direct evidence that the line emission region is optically thick and our multi-wavelength photometric measurements are used to determine the inner accretion disk and boundary layer temperatures during superoutburst. Using a determined distance to WX Cet of ~130 pc, we find T$_{ID}$= 21,000K and T_{BL}~72,500K. Both values are in good agreement with that expected by models of the superoutburst continuum being produced by the inner disk and boundary layer. Comment: Accepted in PASP - July 2002 issue"
1732563,"In this paper, we propose a thermodynamic mechanism for the formation of transcriptional foci via the joint agglomeration of DNA-looping proteins and protein-binding domains on DNA: The competition between the gain in protein-DNA binding free energy and the entropy loss due to DNA looping is argued to result in an effective attraction between loops. A mean-field description can be solved analytically via a mapping to a restricted random-graph ensemble. It shows the emergence of protein clusters containing a finite fraction of all looping proteins. If the entropy loss due to a single DNA loop is high enough, this transition is found to be of first order."
1732564,". We report on a study of exotic nuclei around doubly magic 132Sn in terms of the shell model employing a realistic effective interaction derived from the CD-Bonn nucleon-nucleon potential. The short-range repulsion of the bare potential is renormalized by constructing a smooth low-momentum potential, Vlow-k, that is used directly as input for the calculation of the effective interaction. In this paper we focus attention on the nuclei 134Sn and 135Sb which, with an N/Z ratio of 1.68 and 1.65, respectively, are at present the most exotic nuclei beyond 132Sn for which information exists on excited states. Comparison shows that the calculated results for both nuclei are in very good agreement with the experimental data. We present our predictions of the hitherto unknown spectrum of 136Sn."

The transistor has two gate pads that can be biased independently. It can be switched ON or OFF with a few mV change in the differential bias between the two pads, resulting in extremely low dynamic power dissipation during switching. The ratio of ON to OFF conductance remains fairly large (~ 60) up to a temperature of 10 K. This device also has excellent inverter characteristics, making it attractive for applications in low power and high density Boolean logic circuits."
1732566,"Criteria for gravitational collapse of expanding shells in rotating, shearing galaxy discs were determined using three-dimensional numerical simulations in the thin shell approximation. The simulations were run over a grid of seven independent variables, and the resultant probabilities for triggering and unstable masses were determined as functions of eight dimensionless parameters. When the ratio of the midplane gas density to the midplane total density is small, an expanding shell reaches the disc scaleheight and vents to the halo before it collapses. When the Toomre instability parameter Q, or a similar shear parameter, QA, is large, Coriolis forces and shear stall or reverse the collapse before the shell accumulates enough mass to be unstable. With large values of csh5/(GL), for rms velocity dispersion csh in the swept-up matter and shell-driving luminosity L, the pressure in the accumulated gas is too large to allow collapse during the expansion time. Considering ∼5000 models covering a wide range of parameter space, the common properties of shell collapse as a mechanism for triggered star formation are: (1) the time-scale is ∼4(csh/2πGρ[GL]0.2)0.5 for ambient midplane density ρ, (2) the total fragment mass is ∼2 × 107 M⊙, of which only a small fraction is likely to be molecular, (3) the triggering radius is ∼2 times the scaleheight, and the triggering probability is ∼0.5 for large OB associations. Star formation triggered by shell collapse should be most common in gas-rich galaxies, such as young galaxies or those with late Hubble types."
1732567,"Temporal broadening of pulsar signals results from electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium that cause the radiation to travel along paths of different lengths. The theory of Gaussian fluctuations predicts that the pulse temporal broadening should scale with the wavelength as λ4 and with the dispersion measure (DM; proportional to the distance to the pulsar) as DM2. However, for large dispersion measures, DM > 20 pc cm-3, the observed scaling is λ4DM4, contradicting the conventional theory. Although the problem has existed for 30 years, there has been no resolution to this paradox. We suggest that scintillations for distant pulsars are caused by non-Gaussian, spatially intermittent density fluctuations with a power-law-like probability distribution. Such a probability distribution does not have a second moment, and therefore the previously applied conventional Fokker-Planck theory does not hold. Instead, we propose to apply the theory of Lévy distributions (so-called Lévy flights). We show that the observed scaling is recovered for large DM if the density differences, ΔN, have Lévy distribution decaying as |ΔN|-5/3. In the thin-screen approximation, the corresponding tail of the time-profile of the arriving signal is estimated to be I(τ) τ-4/3."
1732568,"We study the expected performance of building a neutrino telescope, which targets at energy greater than 1014 eV utilizing a mountain to interact with neutrinos. The telescope's efficiency in converting neutrinos into leptons is first examined. Then using a potential site on the Big Island of Hawaii, we estimate the acceptance of the proposed detector. The neutrino flux limit at event rate 0.3/year/half decade of energy is estimated to be comparable to that of AMANDA neutrino flux limit at above 1.E16 eV."
1732569,"A scenario for a periodic filling and emptying of the accretion disc of the microquasar GRS 1915+105 is proposed, by computing the mass transfer rate from the evolving low mass red giant donor (Greiner at al. 2001) and comparing it with the observed accretion rate onto the primary black hole. We propose a duty-cycle with (5-10)(eta/0.1) per cent active ON-state where eta is the efficiency of converting accretion into radiation. The duration of the quiescent recurrent OFF-state is identified as the viscosity time scale at the circularization radius and equals 370(alpha/0.001)^(-4/5) years, where alpha is the viscosity parameter in the alpha-prescription of a classical disc. If the viscosity at the outer edge of the disc is small and eta is close to the maximum available potential energy (per rest mass energy) at the innermost stable orbit, the present active phase may last another 10 - 20 years.

1732570,"We discuss the methods used to compile a high signal-to-noise dataset representative of both the instrumental and cosmic background signal measured at high galactic latitude by the XMM-Newton EPIC cameras. The characteristics of the EPIC background are described and the potential applications of the derived dataset in general science analysis are outlined. In the case of the cosmic X-ray background, the transition between a hard power-law spectrum (due to the integrated emission of unresolved, largely extragalactic, point sources) and a softer thermal spectrum (produced by hot plasma associated with the Galactic plane and halo) is unambiguously detected around ~1keV. We derive a value for the intensity of the power-law component of 2.15 (+/- 0.26) e-11 erg/sq cm/s/sq deg in the 2-10 keV band (Normalisation at 1keV of 11.1 photons /sq cm/s/sr/keV). The implication is that recent, very deep Chandra observations have resolved ~70 - 90% of the 2-10 keV background into discrete sources. Our measurement is towards the higher end of the range of quoted background normalisations. Comment: 14 pages 11 figures, accepted for A&A"

Each of the arguments is commented in detail from the point of view of the required physics. It is shown that the arguments are unacceptable from the physical point of view, e.g. we should not use general equation of motion which cannot be reduced to the special case treated by Einstein in 1905. Detail explanations should help astronomers in better physical understanding of the equation of motion."

In this Letter we investigate the overall viability of an open linear coasting cosmological model. We report that this model is consistent with gravitational lensing statistics (within 1sigma) and accommodates old high-redshift galaxies. We finally conclude that such a linear coasting, alpha(t) = t, is not ruled out on basis of these observational tests. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V."
1732574,"We examine 3 analytic theories of magnetospheric accretion onto classical T Tauri stars under the assumption that the magnetic field strength does not vary appreciably from star to star. From these investigations we derive predicted relationships among the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate. Data from 5 studies of the accretion parameters of CTTSs are used to test the predicted correlations. We generally find that the data do not display the predicted correlations except for that predicted by the model of Shu et al. as detailed by Ostriker and Shu and extended here to include non-dipole field topologies. Their identification of the trapped flux as an important quantity in the model appears to be critical for reconciling the observed data to the theory. While the data do generally support the extended Ostriker and Shu predictions, only one of the two studies for which the requisite data exist show the highest correlation when considering all the relevant parameters. This suggests great care must be taken when trying to use existing observations to test the theory. Comment: 36 pages, including figures"
1732575,"3C 58 is a young Crab-like supernova remnant. Historical evidence strongly suggests an association of the remnant with supernova SN 1181, which would make 3C 58 younger than the Crab Nebula. Recent Chandra observations have identified the young 65 ms pulsar J0205+6449 at its center, embedded in a compact nebula that, as we show here, appears to be confined by the pulsar wind termination shock. We present new Chandra observations of this compact nebula and the embedded pulsar that set strong upper limits on the thermal emission originating from the neutron star surface. These limits fall far below predictions of standard neutron star cooling, requiring the presence of exotic cooling processes in the neutron star core."
1732576,"We constrain f(nu) identical with Omega(nu)/Omega(m), the fractional contribution of neutrinos to the total mass density in the Universe, by comparing the power spectrum of fluctuations derived from the 2 Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey with power spectra for models with four components: baryons, cold dark matter, massive neutrinos, and a cosmological constant. Adding constraints from independent cosmological probes we find f(nu)<0.13 (at 95% confidence) for a prior of 0.1<Omega(m)<0.5, and assuming the scalar spectral index n=1. This translates to an upper limit on the total neutrino mass m(nu,tot)<1.8 eV for ""concordance"" values of Omega(m) and the Hubble constant."
1732577,"We analyse the global structure of the old stellar discs in 34 edge-on spiral galaxies. The radial and vertical exponential scale parameters of the discs are obtained by applying an improved two-dimensional decomposition technique to our I-band photometry. We find a clear increase in the disc scaleheight with maximum rotational velocity, in accordance with observations of the stellar velocity dispersions in galaxy discs. The range and maximum of the intrinsic flattening of the disc light seem to increase with both maximum rotational velocity and total HI mass. We use the disc flattening to estimate the disc contribution to the maximum rotational velocity, resulting in an average of 57+-22 percent. The disc light distributions are further investigated for the presence of radial truncations. We find that the radial light distributions of at least 20 spirals are truncated, corresponding to 60 percent of the sample. For small scalelength spirals, which are the most numerous in the local Universe, the results suggest that the average ratio of disc truncation radius to disc scalelength is at least four.

1732578,"The reflection nebula NGC 2023 was observed by a rocket-borne long-slit imaging spectrograph in the 900-1400 Å bandpass on 2000 February 11. A spectrum of the star, as well as that of the nebular scattered light, was recorded. Through the use of a Monte Carlo modeling process, the scattering properties of the dust were derived. The albedo is low, 0.2-0.4, and decreasing toward shorter wavelengths, while the phase function asymmetry parameter is consistent with highly forward-scattering grains, g ~ 0.85. The decrease in albedo, while the optical depth increases to shorter wavelengths, implies that the far-UV rise in the extinction curve is due to an increase in absorption efficiency."
1732579,"I argue that the presence of magnetic fields around evolved stars, e.g. asymptotic giant branch stars, and in planetary nebulae, does not necessarily imply that the magnetic field plays a global dynamical role in shaping the circumstellar envelope. Instead, I favour magnetic fields with small coherence lengths, which result from stellar magnetic spots or from jets blown by an accreting companion. Although the magnetic field does not play a global role in shaping the circumstellar envelope, it may enhance local motion (turbulent) via magnetic tension and reconnection. The locally strong magnetic tension may enforce coherence flow, which may favour the masing process."
1732580,"Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph slitless spectroscopy of LMC planetary nebulae (PNs) is the ideal tool to study their morphology and their ionization structures at once. We present the results from a group of 29 PNs that have been spatially resolved, for the first time, in all the major optical lines. Images in the light of H, [N ii], and [O iii] are presented, together with line intensities, measured from the extracted one-and two-dimensional spectra. A study on the surface brightness in the different optical lines, the electron densities, the ionized masses, the excitation classes, and the extinction follows, illustrating an ideal consistence with the previous results found by us on LMC PNs. In particular, we find the surface brightness decline with the photometric radius to be the same in most emission lines. We find that asymmetric PNs form a well-defined cooling sequence in the excitation–surface brightness plane, confirming their differ-ent origin and larger progenitor mass."
1732581,"Deep Chandra Low Energy Transmission Grating and High Resolution Camera spectroscopic observations of the isolated neutron star candidate RX J1856.5-3754 have been analyzed to search for metallic and resonance cyclotron spectral features and for pulsation behavior. As found from earlier observations, the X-ray spectrum is well represented by an ~60 eV (7×105 K) blackbody. No unequivocal evidence of spectral line or edge features has been found, arguing against metal-dominated models. The data contain no evidence for pulsation, and we place a 99% confidence upper limit of 2.7% on the unaccelerated pulse fraction over a wide frequency range from 10-4 to 100 Hz.

1732582,"We present the results of 16-s time-scale spectral fits for Cygnus X-1 in the soft state and in the transition state, using a Comptonized blackbody plus an iron line. On these time-scales, we find that that the continuum source flux can vary by factors 2–3 and that the iron-line intensity appears to track these changes well, i.e. the inferred equivalent width of the line remains constant to within the errors. We also find no significant changes in the seed (blackbody) photon temperature, while the properties of the Comptonizing corona clearly do vary, with the spectral hardness and flux generally being correlated. The corona therefore seems to be the overall driver for the rapid time-scale variability observed in the soft and transition states. These results are consistent with the Fourier resolved spectroscopy results of Gilfanov, Churazov & Revnivtsev that indicate the iron line shows rapid flux variations while the blackbody component does not, and suggest that the iron-line flux, in fact, tracks continuum changes down to very short time-scales. We extend this work by showing that not only the variability amplitudes, but also the phases of the iron line and continuum components are identical. We note that the short-time-scale variability properties of the soft and transition states are actually not very different from those of the hard state, suggesting that the corona is the main cause of rapid variability in that state too, and hence that the mechanism responsible for the corona is similar in all three states."
1732583,"We investigate the correlation between the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) mass (Mbh) and the stellar velocity dispersion (σ*) in two types of host galaxies: the early-type bulges (disc galaxies with classical bulges or elliptical galaxies) and pseudo-bulges. In the form log (Mbh/M⊙) =+β log (σ*/200 km s−1), the best-fitting results for the 39 early-type bulges are the slope β= 4.06 ± 0.28 and the normalization = 8.28 ± 0.05; the best-fitting results for the nine pseudo-bulges are β= 4.5 ± 1.3 and = 7.50 ± 0.18. Both relations have intrinsic scatter in log Mbh of ≲0.27 dex. The Mbh–σ* relation for pseudo-bulges is different from the relation in the early-type bulges over the 3σ significance level. The contrasting relations indicate the formation and growth histories of SMBHs depend on their host type. The discrepancy between the slope of the Mbh–σ* relations using different definition of velocity dispersion vanishes in our sample, a uniform slope will constrain the coevolution theories of the SMBHs and their host galaxies more effectively. We also find the slope for the ‘core’ elliptical galaxies at the high-mass range of the relation appears steeper (β≃ 5–6), which may be the imprint of their origin of dissipationless mergers."
1732584,"Using current semi-analytic models of structure and star formation based on hierarchical clustering, we connect the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) to the X-ray emission properties of groups and clusters of galaxies. We show that when the baryons cool down from a hot phase to condense into stars with a SFR flat for z>2, then such hot phase yields deep X-ray source counts (at fluxes F=10^{-15} erg/cm^2 s in the energy band 0.5-2 keV) about 5 times larger than in the case of a SFR peaked at z ~ 1.5. We also discuss the effect of the SFR on the shape and evolution of the X-ray L-T relation."
1732585,"Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at $z \sim 3$ exhibit number densities and clustering similar to local $L_*$ galaxies; however, their star formation rates (SFRs) are much higher. We explore the scenario in which LBGs are starburst galaxies triggered by collisions, and thus provide an explanation for these key properties. The relative paucity of starburst galaxies at low redshift can be attributed to a much higher collision rate in the past. We use high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulations and a hierarchical halo finder to estimate the galaxy collision rate as a function of time in the popular $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We find that bright collisional starbursts are frequent enough to account for most of the high-$z$ ($2.5-4.5$) LBGs. Moreover, many of the objects are of relatively small mass, but they cluster about large-mass halos. They therefore exhibit strong clustering, similar to that observed and stronger than that of the relevant massive halos.

1732586,"An axisymmetric MHD model is examined analytically to illustrate some key aspects of the physics of hot and magnetized outflows which originate in the near environment of a central gravitating body. By analyzing the asymptotical behaviour of the outflows it is found that they attain a variety of shapes such as conical, paraboloidal or cylindrical. However, non cylindrical asymptotics can be achieved only when the magnetic pinching is negligible and the outflow is overpressured on its symmetry axis. In cylindrical jet-type asymptotics, the outflowing plasma reaches an equilibrium wherein it is confined by magnetic forces or gas pressure gradients, while it is supported by centrifugal forces or gas pressure gradients. In which of the two regimes (with thermal or magnetic confinement) a jet can be found depends on the efficiency of the central magnetic rotator. The radius and terminal speed of the jet are analytically given in terms of the variation across the poloidal streamlines of the total energy. Large radius of the jet and efficient acceleration are best obtained when the external confinement is provided with comparable contributions by magnetic pinching and thermal pressure. In most cases, collimated streamlines undergo oscillations with various wavelengths, as also found by other analytical models. Scenarios for the evolution of outflows into winds and jets in the different confinement regimes are shortly outlined."
1732588,A self-consistent analysis of the currents in a tokamak yields the result that the parallel neutralizing current is given simply by the sum of currents commonly called the bootstrap current and the Pfirsch-Schlueter current.

1732589,"We compute the chemical and thermal history of the intra-cluster medium in rich and poor clusters under the assumption that supernovae (I, II) are the major responsible both for the chemical enrichment and the heating of the intra-cluster gas. We assume that only ellipticals and S0 galaxies contribute to the enrichment and heating of the intra-cluster gas through supernova driven winds and explore several prescriptions for describing the feedback between supernovae and the interstellar medium in galaxies. We then integrate the chemical and energetical contributions from single cluster galaxies over the cluster luminosity function and derive the variations of these quantities as functions of the cosmic time. We reach the following conclusions: (i) while type II supernovae dominates the chemical enrichment and energetics inside the galaxies, type Ia supernovae play a predominant role in the intra-cluster medium, (ii) galaxy models, which reproduce the observed chemical abundances and abundance ratios in the intra-cluster medium, predict a maximum of 0.3–0.4 keV per particle of energy input, a result obtained by assuming that type Ia supernovae contribute 100% of their initial blast wave energy whereas type II supernovae contribute only a few percents of their initial energy."
1732590,"Using a sample of 3814 quasars from the Early Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we confirm that high-ionization, broad emission lines, such as C IV, are significantly blueshifted with respect to low-ionization, broad emission lines, such as Mg II, which are thought to be close to the systemic redshift. We examine the velocity shifts of the Mg II and C IV emission lines with respect to [O III] and Mg II, respectively. C IV emission-line peaks have a range of shifts from a redshift of 500 km s-1 to blueshifts well in excess of 2000 km s-1 as compared with Mg II. We confirm previous results that suggest an anticorrelation between the shift of the C IV emission-line peak and the rest equivalent width of the C IV emission line. Furthermore, by creating composite quasar spectra as a function of C IV shift, we are able to study in detail the profiles of the line as a function of velocity shift. We find that the apparent shift of the C IV emission-line peak is not a shift so much as it is a lack of flux in the red wing for the composite with the largest apparent shift. This observation should strongly constrain models for the broad emission-line region in quasars. The emission-line blueshift and equivalent width of C IV are also discussed in light of the well-known anticorrelation between the equivalent width of C IV emission and continuum luminosity, otherwise known as the Baldwin effect. We further discuss the C IV emission-line shift as a function of other quasar properties, such as spectral index, radio and X-ray detection. We find a possible correlation between the C IV emission-line shifts and the radio properties of the quasars, which is suggestive of orientation as the cause of the C IV velocity shifts. Finally, we explore whether the C IV emission-line blueshifts correlate with the presence of broad absorption line absorption troughs or with narrow, ""associated"" absorption, and how these might be related to orientation."
1732591,"We use high resolution numerical simulations to investigate the adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos with a Hernquist density profile. We test the response of the halos to the growth of additional axisymmetric disk potentials with various central concentrations and the spherically symmetric potential of a softened point mass. Adding the potentials on timescales that are long compared to the dynamical time scale of the halo, the contracted halos have density profiles that are in excellent agreement with analytical predictions based on the conservation of the adiabatic invariant $M(r)r$. This is surprising as this quantity is strictly conserved only for particles on circular orbits and in spherically symmetric potentials. If the same potentials are added on timescales that are short compared to the dynamical timescale, the result depends strongly on the adopted potential. The adiabatic approximation still works for disk potentials. It does, however, fail for the central potential. Comment: 7 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. Added reference. Accepted for publication in ApJL"
1732592,"We have investigated the mass loss processes in Long Period Variables, by combining radiative transfer modeling with mid-IR imaging and spectroscopic observations.

Semiregular and Irregular variables are characterized by frequent interruptions in their mass loss rate, on timescales of ~100 yr. High resolution imaging of individual Long Period Variable sources show departures from spherical symmetry.

1732593,"We use the Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze interactions of the blast wave and the inhomogeneous interstellar medium on the western limb of the Cygnus Loop supernova remnant. This field of view includes an initial interaction between the blast wave and a large cloud, as well as the encounter of the shock front and the shell that surrounds the cavity of the supernova progenitor. Uniquely, the X-rays directly trace the shock front in the dense cloud, where we measure temperature kT = 0.03 keV. We find kT~0.2 keV in regions where reflected shocks further heat previously-shocked material. Applying one-dimensional models to these interactions, we determine the original blast wave velocity v_bw~330 km/s in the ambient medium. We do not detect strong evidence for instabilities or non-equilibrium conditions on the arcsecond scales we resolve. These sensitive, high-resolution data indicate no exceptional abundance variations in this region of the Cygnus Loop."
1732594,"We report the detection of a ringlike H i structure toward l ¼ 90=0, b ¼ 2=8, with a velocity of v LSR ¼ À99 km s À1 . This velocity implies a distance of d ¼ 13 kpc, corresponding to a Galactocentric radius of R gal ¼ 15 kpc. The l-v LSR diagram implies an expansion velocity of v exp ' 15 km s À1 for the shell. The structure has an oblate, irregular shell-like appearance, which surrounds weak infrared emission as seen in the 60 lm Infra-red Astronomical Satellite data. At a distance of 13 kpc the size of the object is about 110 Â 220 pc and placed 500 pc above the Galactic plane, with a mass of 10 5 M .

1732597,"We present an approximate form for the weak lensing magnification distribution of standard candles, valid for all cosmological models, with arbitrary matter distributions, over all redshifts. Our results are based on a universal probability distribution function (UPDF), $P(\eta)$, for the reduced convergence, $\eta$. For a given cosmological model, the magnification probability distribution, $P(\mu)$, at redshift $z$ is related to the UPDF by $P(\mu)=P(\eta)/2|\kappa_{min}|$, where $\eta=1+(\mu-1)/(2|\kappa_{min}|)$, and $\kappa_{min}$ (the minimum convergence) can be directly computed from the cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$). We show that the UPDF can be well approximated by a three-parameter stretched Gaussian distribution, where the values of the three parameters depend only on $\xi_\eta$, the variance of $\eta$. In short, all possible weak lensing probability distributions can be well approximated by a one-parameter family. We establish this family, normalizing to the numerical ray-shooting results for a ${\Lambda}$CDM model by Wambsganss et al. (1997). Each alternative cosmological model is then described by a single function $\xi_\eta(z)$. We find that this method gives $P(\mu)$ in excellent agreement with numerical ray-tracing and three-dimensional shear matrix calculations, and provide numerical fits for three representative models (SCDM, $\Lambda$CDM, and OCDM). Our results provide an easy, accurate, and efficient method to calculate the weak lensing magnification distribution of standard candles, and should be useful in the analysis of future high-redshift supernova data.

1732598,"We analyse the general radiation emission mechanism from a charged particle moving in a curved inhomogeneous magnetic field. The consideration of the gradient makes the vacuum magnetic field compatible with the Maxwell equations, and adds a non-trivial term to the transverse drift velocity, and, consequently, to the general radiation spectrum. To obtain the radiation spectrum in the classical domain a general expression for the spectral distribution and characteristic frequency of an electron in arbitrary motion is derived, by using Schwinger's method. The radiation patterns of the ultrarelativistic electron are represented in terms of the acceleration of the particle. The same results can be obtained by considering that the motion of the electron can be formally described as an evolution caused by magnetic and electric forces. By defining an effective electromagnetic field, which combines the magnetic field with the fictitious electric field associated to the curvature and drift motion, one can obtain all the physical characteristics of the radiation by replacing the constant magnetic field with the effective field. The power, angular distribution and spectral distribution of all three components (synchrotron, curvature and gradient) of the radiation are considered, in both the classical and the quantum domain, within the framework of this unified formalism. In the quantum domain the proposed approach allows the study of the effects of the inhomogeneities and curvature of the magnetic field on the radiative transition rates of electrons between low-lying Landau levels and the ground state."
1732599,"We investigate gas metallicity of narrow-line regions in narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and broad-line ones (BLS1s) in order to examine whether or not there is a difference in the gas metallicity between the two populations of Seyfert 1 galaxies. We apply two methods to study this issue. One is to use the emission-line flux ratio of [N II]6583/H_alpha in combination with some other optical emission-line flux ratios. This method, which has been often applied to Seyfert 2 galaxies, suggests that the gas metallicity of narrow-line regions is indistinguishable or possibly higher in BLS1s than in NLS1s. On the contrary, the other method in which only forbidden emission-line fluxes are used results in that NLS1s tend to possess metal-richer gas in the narrow-line regions than BLS1s. We point out that this inconsistency may be owing to the contamination of the broad component of permitted lines into the narrow component of ones in the first method. Since the results derived by using only forbidden emission-line fluxes do not suffer from any uncertainty of the fitting function for the broad component of Balmer lines, the results from this method are more reliable than those derived by using permitted lines. We thus conclude that the gas metallicity of narrow-line regions tends to be higher in NLS1s than in BLS1s. Comment: 12 pages including 10 figures, to appear in The Astrophysical Journal"
1732600,"The X-ray emission from normal elliptical galaxies has two major components: soft emission from diffuse gas and harder emission from populations of accreting (low-mass) stellar X-ray binaries (LMXB). If LMXB populations are tied to the field stellar populations in galaxies, their total X-ray luminosities should be proportional to the optical luminosities of galaxies. However, recent ASCA and Chandra X-ray observations show that the global luminosities of LMXB components in ellipticals exhibit significant scatter at a given optical luminosity. This scatter may reflect a range of evolutionary stages among LMXB populations in ellipticals of different ages. If so, the ratio of the global LMXB X-ray luminosity to the galactic optical luminosity, L_LMXB/L_opt, may be used to determine when the bulk of stars were formed in individual ellipticals. To test this, we compare variations in L_LMXB/L_opt for LMXB populations in ellipticals to optically-derived estimates of stellar ages in the same galaxies. We find no correlation, implying that L_LMXB/L_opt variations are not good age indicators for ellipticals. Alternatively, LMXBs may be formed primarily in globular clusters (through stellar tidal interactions), rather than in the stellar fields of galaxies. Since elliptical galaxies exhibit a wide range of globular cluster populations for a given galaxian luminosity, this may induce a dispersion in the LMXB populations of ellipticals with similar optical luminosities. Indeed, we find that L_LMXB/L_opt ratios for LMXB populations are strongly correlated with the specific globular cluster frequencies in elliptical galaxies. This suggests that most LMXBs were formed in globular clusters. Comment: 5 pages, emulateapj5 style, 2 embedded EPS figures, to appear in ApJ Letters"
1732601,"In this letter we investigate the kinematical properties of early-type dwarfs by significantly enlarging the scarce observational sample so far available. We present rotation curves and mean velocity dispersions for four bright dwarf ellipticals and two dwarf lenticular galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Most of these galaxies exhibit conspicuous rotation curves. In particular, five out of the six new galaxies are found to be close to the predictions for oblate spheroids flattened by rotation. Therefore, and contrary to the previous observational hints, the present data suggest that an important fraction of dwarf early-type galaxies may be rotationally supported."

This mesoscopic state can be created with a dynamical process that involves crossing a quantum phase transition and which is supported by the symmetries of the physical system. We characterize the final state by means of a measurable two-particle correlator that detects both the presence of the pairs and their size."
1732603,"We study the evolution of circumbinary disks surrounding classical T Tau stars. High resolution numerical simulations are employed to model a system consisting of a central eccentric binary star within an accretion disk. The disk is assumed to be infinitesimally thin, however a detailed energy balance including viscous heating and radiative cooling is applied. A novel numerical approach using a parallelized Dual-Grid technique on two different coordinate systems has been implemented. Physical parameters of the setup are chosen to model the close system of DQ Tau and AK Sco, as well as the wider systems of GG Tau and UY Aur. Our main findings are for the tight binaries a substantial flow of material through the disk gap which is accreted onto the central stars in a phase dependent process. We are able to constrain the parameters of the systems by matching both accretion rates and derived spectral energy distributions to observational data where available."
1732604,"We present the results of a BeppoSAX observation of the black hole candidate GRS1758-258 carried out in 1997, while the source was in its low/hard state. The X-ray spectrum, simultaneously observed over the broad energy range from 0.1 to 200 keV, can be well described by a Comptonized emission model with electron temperature kT_e = 31.4 keV and optical depth of 4.0 (spherical geometry), although a cut-off power-law and a reflection model cannot be excluded. Additionally, a broad iron line at 6.4 keV with equivalent width EW = 67 eV has been marginally detected. The 0.1-200 keV luminosity is 1.4x10^37 erg/s for an assumed distance of 8 kpc. The soft and hard luminosities are such that the source falls inside the so-called ""burster box"". No evidence for a soft excess is present.

1732606,"We develop a semi-analytic model of hierarchical galaxy formation with an improved treatment of the evolution of galaxies inside dark matter haloes. We take into account not only dynamical friction processes building up the central dominant galaxy, but also binary aggregations of satellite galaxies inside a common halo described using the kinetic Smoluchowski equation. The description of gas cooling, star formation and evolution, and Supernova feedback follows the standard prescriptions widely used in semi-analytic modelling. We find that binary aggregations are effective in depleting the number of small/intermediate mass galaxies over the redshift range 1<z<3, thus flattening the slope of the luminosity function at the faint end. At z~0 the flattening occurs for -20<M_B<-18, but an upturn is obtained at the very faint end for M_B>-16. We compare our predicted luminosity functions with those obtained from deep multicolor surveys in the rest-frame B and UV bands for the redshift ranges 0<z<1 and 2.5<z<3.5, respectively. The comparison shows that the discrepancy of the predictions of other semi-analytic models with the observations is considerably reduced at z>1 and even more at z ~ 3 by the effect of binary aggregations. The predictions from our dynamical model are discussed and compared with the effects of complementary processes which may conspire in affecting the shape of the luminosity function.

1732607,"The bright blazar Mkn 421 has been observed four times for uninterrupted durations of ~ 9 - 13 hr during the performance verification and calibration phases of the XMM-Newton mission. The source was strongly variable in all epochs, with variability amplitudes that generally increased to higher energy bands. Although the detailed relationship between soft (0.1 - 0.75 keV) and hard (2 - 10 keV) band differed from one epoch to the next, in no case was there any evidence for a measurable interband lag, with robust upper limits of $| \tau | < 0.08 $ hr in the best-correlated light curves. This is in conflict with previous claims of both hard and soft lags of ~1 hr in this and other blazars. However, previous observations suffered a repeated 1.6 hr feature induced by the low-Earth orbital period, a feature that is not present in the uninterrupted XMM-Newton data. The new upper limit on $|\tau|$ leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field strength and Doppler factor of $ B \delta^{1/3} \gs 4.7 $ G, mildly out of line with the predictions from a variety of homogeneous synchrotron self-Compton emission models in the literature of $ B \delta^{1/3} = 0.2 - 0.8 $ G. Time-dependent spectral fitting was performed on all epochs, and no detectable spectral hysteresis was seen. We note however that the source exhibited significantly different spectral evolutionary behavior from one epoch to the next, with the strongest correlations in the first and last and an actual divergance between soft and hard X-ray bands in the third. This indicates that the range of spectral variability behavior in Mkn 421 is not fully described in these short snippets; significantly longer uninterrupted light curves are required, and can be obtained with XMM-Newton.

1732608,"We present the results of an investigation of the effects of Far Ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from hot early type OB stars on clumps in star-forming molecular clouds. Clumps in Photodissociation regions (PDRs) undergo external heating which, if rapid, creates strong photoevaporative mass flows off the clump surfaces, and drives shocks into the clumps, compressing them to high densities. The clumps lose mass on relatively short timescales. The evolution of an individual clump is found to be sensitive to its initial colunm density, the temperature of the heated surface and the ratio of the ``turn-on time'' $t_{FUV}$ of the heating flux on a clump to its initial sound crossing-time $t_{c}$. In this paper, we use spherical 1-D numerical hydrodynamic models as well as approximate analytical models to study the evolution of turbulence-generated and pressure-confined clumps in PDRs. Turbulent clumps evolve so that their column densities are equal to a critical value determined by the local FUV field, and typically have short photoevaporation timescales, $\sim 10^{4-5}$ years for a 1 M$_{\odot}$ clump in a typical star-forming region. Clumps that are confined by an interclump medium may either get completely photoevaporated, or may preserve a shielded core with a warm, dissociated, protective shell that absorbs the incident FUV flux. We compare our results with observations of some well-studied PDRs: the Orion Bar, M17SW, NGC 2023 and the Rosette Nebula. The data are consistent with both interpretations of clump origin, with a slight indication for favouring the turbulent model for clumps over pressure-confined clumps."
1732609,"1.02-1.16 mum spectra (lambda/Deltalambda~7000) of the gravitationally lensed quasi-stellar object (QSO) APM 08279+5255 at zem=3.911 were obtained during the commissioning run of IRCS, the 1-5 mum near-infrared camera and spectrograph for the Subaru 8.2 m Telescope. Strong Mg II doublet lambdalambda2976, 2800 and Fe II lambda2600, Fe II lambda2587 absorption lines at zabs=2.974 were clearly detected in the rest-frame UV spectra, confirming the presence of a damped Lyalpha system at the redshift as suggested by Petitjean et al. In addition, the Mg I lambda2853 absorption line is probably detected. An analysis of the absorption lines including velocity decomposition was performed. This is a first detailed study of the Mg II absorption system at high redshift (z>2.5), where the Mg II doublet shifts into the near-infrared in the observer's frame. The spectra of the lensed QSO pair A and B with 0.38"" separation were resolved in some exposure frames under excellent seeing condition. We extracted the Mg II doublet spectra of A and B separately. Although three velocity components (v~-28, +5, and +45 km s-1) are known to exist in this Mg II system (Petitjean et al.), the v~+45 km s-1 absorption line was not detected toward source B, showing that the +45 km s-1 Mg II cloud lies only in the line of sight to the image A. Our results suggest that the size of the Mg II absorbing clouds is as small as 200 pc, which corresponds to the separation of A and B at the redshift of the absorber. This is the first direct detection of the small-scale structure of Mg II clouds at high redshift, confirming the estimated cloud sizes from the photoionization model by Churchill and Charlton.

1732610,"We present a two-dimensional (2-D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas, by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components, and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use 2-D models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the Sersic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position-angle twists can be modeled accurately in 2-D. When examined in detail, we find that even simple-looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. We illustrate this by way of 7 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare 2-D and 1-D extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei."
1732611,"With the establishment of vanishing net electrostatic fields in a toroidally symmetric tokamak at equilibrium [R. W. Johnson, to appear in Phys. Rev. D], one is left needing an explanation for the measurement of an apparent radial electric field in experiments. Two scenarios are proposed, depending on the type of measurement being considered. Indirect measurement via the radial equation of motion for an impurity species possibly measures that species' net radial viscous force, and direct measurement via the motional Stark effect might reveal electric fields generated by the shifting of the toroidal magnetic flux density."
1732612,"We point out that electromagnetic one-way edge modes analogous to quantum Hall edge states, originally predicted by Raghu and Haldane in 2D photonic crystals possessing Dirac point-derived band gaps, can appear in more general settings. We show that the TM modes in a gyromagnetic photonic crystal can be formally mapped to electronic wave functions in a periodic electromagnetic field, so that the only requirement for the existence of one-way edge modes is that the Chern number for all bands below a gap is nonzero. In a square-lattice yttrium-iron-garnet crystal operating at microwave frequencies, which lacks Dirac points, time-reversal breaking is strong enough that the effect should be easily observable. For realistic material parameters, the edge modes occupy a 10% band gap. Numerical simulations of a one-way waveguide incorporating this crystal show 100% transmission across strong defects."
1732613,"We propose that relativistic Galactic jets like those observed in GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40 may produce small but measurable contributions to the cosmic ray (CR) spectrum. If these jets contain cold protons and heavy ions (as in SS433), it is plausible that this component will consist of a narrow spectral feature, with a mean particle energy corresponding roughly to the bulk kinetic particle energy in the beam, Gamma_jet m c^2, which, based on current estimates of Gamma_jet, falls into the range of 3-10 GeV. The presence of several sources with different Gamma_jet will lead to superposition of several such peaks. Additionally, diffusive particle acceleration should produce a powerlaw whose low energy cutoff at or above Gamma_jet^2 m c^2 would be visible as another spectral feature. The large metallicities measured in several microquasar companions suggest that this CR component could have an anomalous composition compared to the bulk Galactic CRs. We provide estimates of the effects of adiabatic losses, which pose the greatest challenge to models of narrow band CR production in microquasar jets. While the total energy contained in the microquasar CR component is highly uncertain, the CR spectrum in the vicinity of microquasars would be severely affected. AMS02 will be able to probe the low energy CR spectrum for such components and composition anomalies. The spectrally peculiar gamma-ray emission produced by interaction of the ISM with CRs surrounding microquasars might be detectable by GLAST. If the presence of a microquasar CR proton component can be ruled out observationally, this argument could be turned around in favor of electron-positron jets. We show that existing OSSE/GRO and future INTEGRAL data on the Galactic 511 keV line flux put interesting constraints on the particle content of microquasar jets."
1732614,"The double nucleus geometry of M31 is currently best explained by the eccentric disk hypothesis of Tremaine, but whether the eccentric disk resulted from the tidal disruption of an inbounding star cluster by a nuclear black hole, or by an m=1 perturbation of a native nuclear disk, remains debatable. I perform detailed 2-D decomposition of the M31 double nucleus in the Hubble Space Telescope V-band to study the bulge structure and to address competing formation scenarios of the eccentric disk. I deblend the double nucleus (P1 and P2) and the bulge simultaneously using five Sersic and one Nuker components. P1 and P2 appear to be embedded inside an intermediate component (r_e=3.2"") that is nearly spherical (q=0.97+/-m0.02), while the main galaxy bulge is more elliptical (q=0.81+/-0.01). The spherical bulge mass of 2.8x10^7 M_sol is comparable to the supermassive black hole mass (3x10^7 M_sol). In the 2-D decomposition, the bulge is consistent with being centered near the UV peak of P2, but the exact position is difficult to pinpoint because of dust in the bulge. P1 and P2 are comparable in mass. Within a radius r=1\arcsec of P2, the relative mass fraction of the nuclear components is M_BH:M_bulge:P1: P2 = 4.3:1.2:1:0.7, assuming the luminous components have a common mass-to-light ratio of 5.7. The eccentric disk as a whole (P1+P2) is massive, M ~ 2.1x10^7 M_sol, comparable to the black hole and the local bulge mass. As such, the eccentric disk could not have been formed entirely out of stars that were stripped from an inbounding star cluster. Hence, the more favored scenario is that of a disk formed in situ by an m=1 perturbation, caused possibly by the passing of a giant molecular cloud, or the passing/accretion of a small globular cluster.

1732615,"Northern Galactic Planetary nebulae (PNs) are studied to disclose possible correlations between the morphology of the nebulae and the evolution of the central stars (CSs). To this end, we have built the best database available to date, accounting for homogeneity and completeness. We use updated statistical distances, an updated morphological classification scheme, and we calculate Zanstra temperatures for a large sample of PNs. With our study we confirm that round, elliptical, and bipolar PNs have different spatial distributions within the Galaxy, with average absolute distances to the Galactic plane 0.73, 0.38, and 0.21 kpc respectively. We also find evidence that the distributions of the central star's masses are different across these morphological groups, although we do not find that CSs hosted by bipolar PNs are hotter, on average, than CSs within round and elliptical PNs. Our results are in broad agreement with the previous analyses, indicating that round, elliptical, and bipolar PNs evolve from progenitors in different mass ranges, and may belong to different stellar populations, as also indicated by the helium and nitrogen abundances of PNs of different morphology.

1732617,"We have recently shown that in a highly magnetized neutron star atmospheric plasma, vacuum polarization can induce resonant conversion of photon polarization modes via a mechanism analogous to MSW neutrino oscillation.

1732618,"We present the analysis of a Chandra observation of the galaxy cluster A133, which has a cooling flow core, a central radio source, and a diffuse, filamentary radio source that has been classified as a radio relic. The X-ray image shows that the core has a complex structure. The most prominent feature is a ""tongue"" of emission that extends from the central cD galaxy to the northwest and partly overlaps the radio relic. Spectral analysis shows that the emission from the tongue is thermal emission from relatively cool gas at a temperature of ~1.3 keV. One possibility is that this tongue is produced by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities through the interaction between the cold gas around the cD galaxy and hot intracluster medium. We estimate the critical velocity and timescale for the KH instability to be effective for the cold core around the cD galaxy. We find that the KH instability can disrupt the cold core if the relative velocity is 400 km s-1. We compare the results with those of clusters in which sharp, undisrupted cold fronts have been observed; in these clusters, the low-temperature gas in their central regions has a more regular distribution. In contrast to A133, these cluster cores have longer timescales for the disruption of the core by the KH instability when they are normalized to the timescale of the cD galaxy motion. Thus, the other cores are less vulnerable to KH instability. Another possible origin of the tongue is that it is gas that has been uplifted by a buoyant bubble of nonthermal plasma that we identify with the observed radio relic. From the position of the bubble and the radio estimate of the age of the relic source, we estimate a velocity of ~700 km s-1 for the bubble. The structure of the bubble and this velocity are consistent with numerical models for such buoyant bubbles. The energy dissipated by the moving bubble may affect the cooling flow in A133. The combination of the radio and X-ray observations of the radio relic suggest that it is a relic radio lobe formerly energized by the central cD rather than a merger shock-generated cluster radio relic. The lobe may have been displaced from the central cD galaxy by the motion of the cD galaxy or by the buoyancy of the lobe."
1732619,"We present new Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations of the short-period dwarf novae LL And and EF Peg during deep quiescence. We fit stellar models to the UV spectra and use optical and IR observations to determine the physical parameters of the white dwarfs in the systems, the distances to the binaries, and the properties of the secondary stars. Both white dwarfs are relatively cool, having Teff near 15,000 K, and consistent with a mass of 0.6 M☉. The white dwarf in LL And appears to be of solar abundance or slightly lower, while that in EF Peg is near 0.1-0.3 times solar. LL And is found to be 760 pc away, while EF Peg is closer, at 380 pc. EF Peg appears to have an ~M5 V secondary star, consistent with that expected for its orbital period, while the secondary object in LL And remains a mystery."

1732621,"We study the formation of neon-enriched donor stars in ultracompact X-ray binaries (orbital periods P<80 min) and show that their progenitors have to be low-mass (0.3 - 0.4 solar mass) ``hybrid'' white dwarfs (with CO cores and thick helium mantles). Stable mass transfer is possible if in the initial stages of mass exchange mass is lost from the system, taking away the specific orbital angular momentum of the accretor (``isotropic re-emission''). The excess of neon in the transferred matter is due to chemical fractionation of the white dwarf which has to occur prior to the Roche lobe overflow by the donor. The estimated lower limit of the orbital periods of the systems with neon-enriched donors is close to 10 min. We show that the X-ray pulsar 4U 1626-67, which likely also has a neon-enriched companion, may have been formed via accretion induced collapse of an oxygen-neon white dwarf accretor if the donor was a hybrid white dwarf.

1732622,We have returned to our previous Bianchi VIIh analysis in light of the Cruz et al. suggestion that the cold spot observed near the Southern Galactic Pole may be a remnant temperature perturbation of a cosmic texture. Bridges et al. used two favoured left-handed Bianchi VIIh templates with restricted prior probabilities so that the template was centred close to the cold spot. Using Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data ‘corrected’ for the texture fit we have now re-examined both models to assess any changes to these conclusions. We find that both models are left almost entirely unconstrained by the data and consequently exhibit significantly reduced Bayesian evidences. Both models are now disfavoured by the data. This result reinforces our previous assertion that the cold spot was significant in the detection of a Bianchi VIIh component.
1732623,"The properties of the velocity field in the local volume (cz < 550 km/s) have been difficult to constrain due to a lack of a consistent set of galaxy distances. The sparse observations available to date suggest a remarkably quiet flow, with little deviation from a pure Hubble law. However, velocity field models based on the distribution of galaxies in the 1.2 Jy IRAS redshift survey, predict a quadrupolar flow pattern locally with strong infall at the poles of the local Supergalactic plane. We probe this velocity field and begin to establish a consistent set of galactic distances. We have obtained images of nearby galaxies in the I and V band from the W.M. Keck Observatory and in F814W and F555W filters from the Hubble Space Telescope. Where these galaxies are well resolved into stars we may use the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) as a distance indicator. Using a maximum likelihood analysis to quantitatively measure the I magnitude of the TRGB we determine precise distances to seven nearby galaxies: Leo I, Sextans B, NGC 1313, NGC 3109, UGC 03755, UGC 06456, and UGC 07577.

1732625,"We present the 1667 MHz OH megamaser luminosity function derived from a single flux-limited survey. The Arecibo Observatory OH megamaser (OHM) survey has doubled the number of known OH megamasers, and we list the complete catalog of OHMs detected by the survey here, including three redetections of known OHMs. OHMs are produced in major galaxy mergers which are (ultra)luminous in the far-infrared. The OH luminosity function follows a power law in integrated line luminosity, $\Phi \propto L_{OH}^{-0.64}$ per Mpc^3 per dex, and is well-sampled for 10^{2.2} L(sun) < L_{OH} < 10^{3.8} L(sun). The OH luminosity function is incorporated into predictions of the detectability and areal density of OHMs in high redshift OH surveys for a variety of current and planned telescopes and merging evolution scenarios parameterized by (1+z)^m in the merger rate ranging from m=0 (no evolution) to m=8 (extreme evolution). Up to dozens of OHMs may be detected per square degree per 50 MHz by a survey reaching an rms noise of 100 microJy per 0.1 MHz channel. An adequately sensitive ``OH Deep Field'' would significantly constrain the evolution exponent m even if no detections are made. In addition to serving as luminous tracers of massive mergers, OHMs may also trace highly obscured nuclear starburst activity and the formation of binary supermassive black holes.

1732626,"We obtained four Chandra/ACIS-S observations beginning 2 weeks after the end of the 2000 November outburst of the neutron star (NS) transient Aql X-1. Over the 5 month span in quiescence, the X-ray spectra are consistent with thermal emission from a NS with a pure hydrogen photosphere and R∞ = 15.9 (d/5 kpc) km at the optically implied X-ray column density. We also detect a hard power-law tail during two of the four observations. The intensity of Aql X-1 first decreased by 50% ± 4% over 3 months, then increased by 35% ± 5% in 1 month, and then remained constant (<6% change) over the last month. These variations in the first two observations cannot be explained by a change in either the power-law spectral component or the X-ray column density. Presuming a pure hydrogen atmosphere and that R∞ is not variable, the long-term changes can only be explained by variations in the NS effective temperature, from kTeff,∞ = 130 eV, down to 113 eV, and finally increasing to 118 eV for the final two observations. During one of these observations, we observe two phenomena that were previously suggested as indicators of quiescent accretion onto the NS: short-timescale (<104 s) variability (at 32% rms) and a possible absorption feature near 0.5 keV. The possible absorption feature can potentially be explained as being due to a time-variable response in the ACIS detector. Even so, such a feature has not been detected previously from a NS and, if confirmed and identified, can be exploited for simultaneous measurements of the photospheric redshift and NS radius."

Besides proving existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on the initial datum, we shall be mainly concerned with the asymptotic behaviour of the solution.

1732628,"We calculate global $m=1$ modes with low pattern speed corresponding to introducing a finite eccentricity into a protoplanetary disc. We consider disc models which are either isolated or contain one or two protoplanets orbiting in an inner cavity. Global modes that are strongly coupled to inner protoplanets are found to have disc orbits which tend to have apsidal lines antialigned with respect to those of the inner protoplanets. Other modes corresponding to free disc modes may be global over a large range of length scales and accordingly be long lived. We consider the motion of a protoplanet in the earth mass range embedded in an eccentric disc and determine the equilibrium orbits which maintain fixed apsidal alignment with respect to the disc gas orbits. Equilibrium eccentricities are found to be comparable or possibly exceed the disc eccentricity. We then approximately calculate the tidal interaction with the disc in order to estimate the orbital migration rate. Results are found to deviate from the case of axisymmetric disc with near circular protoplanet orbit once eccentricities of protoplanet and disc orbits become comparable to the disc aspect ratio in magnitude. Aligned protoplanet orbits with very similar eccentricity to that of the gas disc are found to undergo litle eccentricity change while undergoing inward migration in general. However, for significantly larger orbital eccentricities, migration may be significantly reduced or even reverse from inwards to outwards. Thus the existence of global non circular motions in discs with radial excursions comparable to the semi-thickness may have important consequences for the migration and survival of protoplanetary cores in the earth mass range.

1732629,"Near-infrared observations of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts z~3 are beginning to provide constraints on ages, star-formation histories, dust content, metallicities, and stellar masses. At present, uncertainties of more than an order of magnitude are typical for many of these parameters. It is nonetheless interesting to ask what the stellar-population models imply for the existence and luminosities of Lyman-break galaxies at higher redshift. To this end we examine the inferred star-formation rates in two well-studied samples of galaxies as a function of redshift out to z = 10 for various best-fit and limiting cases. Taken at face value, the generally young ages (typically 10^8 +- 0.5 yr) of the z = 3 Lyman break galaxies imply that their stars were not present much beyond z=4. By z = 6 the cosmic star-formation rate from the progenitors of these galaxies is less than 10% of star-formation rate at z=3 +- 0.5, even for maximally-old models, provided the derivative of the star-formation rate SFR(t) is monotonic. The escaping Lyman-continuum radiation from such galaxies would be insufficient to reionize the IGM. Thus other sources of ionizing photons (e.g. very massive population III stars) may be needed, and the more normal Lyman-break galaxies may be a phenomenon confined to redshifts z <~ 4. This conclusion changes if SFR(t) was episodic, and we examine the parameters of such bursty star-formation that might be consistent with both the z=2-4 luminosity functions and the z~3 spectral energy distributions.

These measurements remove observational support for an extremely soft equation of state. The star's birthplace is still likely to be in the Upper Sco association, but a connection with zeta Oph is now unlikely. Comment: submitted to ApJ Letters"
1732631,"Only a small fraction of galactic nuclei in the nearby universe are luminous; most of them are currently dim. We investigate the feasibility of constraining the X-ray luminosity in the recent past (up to similar to10(6) years ago) of the nucleus of a cluster dominant galaxy by measuring the contribution of scattered radiation from the central source to the surface brightness of the intracluster gas dominated by thermal emission. We show that resonance X-ray lines present an advantage over the adjacent continuum, because the relative contribution of the scattered component is typically larger in the line case by a significant factor of 3-10. As an example, we estimate the level of constraint that could be derived from future fine spectroscopic observations on the past X-ray luminosity of the nearby M 87 and Cygnus A active galaxies. For instance, scattered line radiation should be detectable from the Virgo cluster if the X-ray luminosity of M 87 was a few times 10(44) erg s(-1),or 10(-3) of its Eddington luminosity, until a few times 10(5) years ago. For comparison, upper limits inferred from the available XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray continuum data are typically 1-2 orders of magnitude weaker. The same method can be applied to distant powerful quasars (at redshifts z greater than or similar to 1) if they have cluster- like gaseous coronae, as suggested by Rosat and Chandra observations of active galaxies at z less than or similar to 1. Their surface brightness profiles in the X-ray continuum above similar to10 keV >> kT/(1 + z)(where T is the gas temperature) should be dominated by redshifted scattered radiation from the quasar. Therefore, measurements with forthcoming mirror-optics hard X-ray telescopes could give information on the lifetime of quasars and parameters of the hot gas around them."
1732632,"The fields of eight X-ray sources in the Magellanic Clouds believed to be Be/X-ray binaries have been searched for possible Be-star counterparts. BVRc and H CCD imaging was employed to identify early-type emission stars through colour indices and H fluxes. Spectroscopy of five sources confirms the presence of H emission in each case. Based on the positional coincidence of emission-line objects with the X-ray sources, we identify Be-star counterparts to the ROSAT sources RX J0032.9-7348, RX J0049.1-7250, RX J0054.9-7226 and RX J0101.0-7206, and to the recently discovered ASCA source AX J0051-722. We confirm the Be star nature of the counterpart to the HEAO1 source H0544-66. In the field of the ROSAT source RX J0051.8-7231 we find that there are three possible counterparts, each showing evidence for H emission. We find a close double in the error circle of the EXOSAT source EXO 0531.1-6609, each component of which could be a Be star associated with the X-ray source."
1732633,In this paper a Neural Network based approach is presented to identify the noise in the VIRGO context. VIRGO is an experiment to detect Gravitational Waves by means of a Laser Interferometer. Preliminary results appear to be very promising for data analysis of realistic Interferometer outputs.
1732634,"We discuss the technique of Wide-field imaging as it applies to Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the past VLBI data sets were usually averaged so severely that the field-of-view was typically restricted to regions extending a few hundred milliarcseconds from the phase centre of the field. Recent advances in data analysis techniques, together with increasing data storage capabilities, and enhanced computer processing power, now permit VLBI images to be made whose angular size represents a significant fraction of an individual antenna's primary beam. This technique has recently been successfully applied to several large separation gravitational lens systems, compact Supernova Remnants in the starburst galaxy M82, and two faint radio sources located within the same VLA FIRST field. It seems likely that other VLBI observing programmes might benefit from this wide-field approach to VLBI data analysis. With the raw sensitivity of global VLBI set to improve by a factor 4–5 over the coming few years, the number of sources that can be detected in a given field will rise considerably. In addition, a continued progression in VLBI's ability to image relatively faint and extended low brightness temperature features (such as hot-spots in large-scale astrophysical jets) is also to be expected. As VLBI sensitivity approaches the μJy level, a wide-field approach to data analysis becomes inevitable."

1732636,"With SIRTF and NGST in the offing, it is interesting to examine what the stellar populations of z~3 galaxies models imply for the existence and nature of Lyman-break galaxies at higher redshift. To this end, we ``turn back the clock'' on the stellar population models that have been fit to optical and infrared data of Lyman-break galaxies at z~3. The generally young ages (typically 10^8 +- 0.5 yr) of these galaxies imply that their stars were not present much beyond z=4. For smooth star-formation histories SFR(t) and Salpeter IMFs, the ionizing radiation from early star-formation in these galaxies would be insufficient to reionize the intergalactic medium at z~6, and the luminosity density at z~4 would be significantly lower than observed. We examine possible ways to increase the global star-formation rate at higher redshift without violating the stellar-population constraints at z~3.

1732637,"In the standard cosmological paradigm cosmic acceleration is to only be a very recent (viz. $z \leq 1$) phenomenon, with the universe being required to be decelerating at all higher redshifts. We suggest that this particular expectation of the standard model is to be viewed as a quite definitive test not only of the model itself but also of the fine-tuning assumption on which the expectation is based, with the expectation itself actually being readily amenable to testing once the Hubble plot can be extended out to only $z=2$ or so. Moreover, such a modest extension of the Hubble plot will also provide for definitive testing of the non fine-tuned alternate conformal gravity theory, a theory in which the universe is to accelerate both above and below $z=1$.

1732638,"The realization that GRBs release a constant amount of energy implies that the post jet-break afterglow evolution would be largely universal. For a given redshift all afterglows should be detected up to a fixed observer angle. We estimate the observed magnitude and the implied detectability of orphan afterglows. We show that for reasonable limiting magnitudes ($m_{lim}=25$) orphan afterglows would typically be detected from small ($\sim 10^\circ$) angles away from the GRB jet axis. A detected orphan afterglow would generally correspond to a ""near-miss"" of the GRB whose jet was pointing just slightly away from us. With our most optimistic parameters we expect that 15 orphan afterglows will be recorded in the SDSS and 35 transients will be recorded in a dedicated 2m class telescope operating full time for a year in an orphan afterglow search. The rate is smaller by a factor of 15 for our ""canonical"" parameters. We show that for a given facility an optimal survey should be shallower, covering larger area rather than deeper. The limiting magnitude should not be, however, lower than $\sim$ 23rd as in this case more transients from on-axis GRBs will be discovered than orphan afterglows. About 15% of the transients could be discovered with a second exposure of the same area provided that it follows after 3, 4 and 8 days for $m_{lim}=23$, 25 and 27.

1732639,"Recent results from the KASCADE extensive air shower experiment are presented. After briefly reviewing the status of the experiment we report on tests of hadronic interaction models and emphasize the progress being made in understanding the properties and origin of the knee at $E_{knee} ~ 4.10^{15} eV. Analysing the muon- and hadron trigger rates in the KASCADE calorimeter as well as the global properties of high energy hadrons in the shower core leads us to conclude that QGSJET still provides the best overall description of EAS data, being superior to DPMJET II-5 and neXus 2, for example. Performing high statistics CORSIKA simulations and applying sophisticated unfolding techniques to the electron and muon shower size distributions, we are able to successfully deconvolute the all-particle energy spectrum into energy spectra of 4 individual primary mass groups (p, He, C, Fe). Each of these preliminary energy distributions exhibits a knee like structure with a change of their knee positions suggesting a constant rigidity of R ~ 2-3 PV."

1732641,"A phenomenological analysis of radiative $V\to P\gamma$ and $P\to V\gamma$ decays is performed in order to determine the gluonic content of the $\eta^\prime$ wave function. Our result shows that there is no evidence for such a gluonium contribution, $Z_{\eta^\prime}^2=0.04\pm 0.09$. In terms of a mixing angle description this corresponds to $\phi_P=(41.4\pm 1.3)^\circ$ and $|\phi_{\eta^\prime G}|=(12\pm 13)^\circ$."
1732642,"A method is developed to evaluate the magni cations of the images of galaxies with lensing potentials strati ed on similar concentric ellipses. In a quadruplet system, there are two even parity images, two odd parity images, together with a de-magni ed and usually missing central image. A simple contour integral is provided which enables the sums of the magni cations of the even parity or the odd parity images or the central image to be separately calculated without explicit solution of the lens equation. We nd that the sums for pairs of images generally vary considerably with the position of the source, while the signed sums of the two pairs can be remarkably uniform inside the tangential caustic in the absence of naked cusps."
1732643,The CMB Planck satellite (ESA) will provide a catalogue of nearly 30000 galaxy clusters (Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect) between redshift 0 and approx. 2-3 (depending on the cosmological model). This hughe catalogue of clusters will allow detailed studies of the evolution of the cluster population with redshift which will constrain the cosmological model. The identification of the high redshift clusters should be done with a large telescope (like GTC) since Planck data alone will not provide any clue about the redshift of the clusters. In this work we show that an optical follow up of only 300 clusters (randomly selected from the Planck catalogue) is needed in order to distinguish models with or without a cosmological constant.
1732644,"Numerical simulations of kinematic dynamo action in steady and 3-d ABC flows are presented with special focus on growth rates and multiple periods of the prescribed velocity field. It is found that the difference in growth rate is due to differences in the recycling of the weakest part of the magnetic field. Differences in the topology in cases with and without stagnation points in the imposed velocity field are also investigated, and it is found that the cigar-like structures that develop in the classical A=B=C dynamos, are replaced by ribbon structures in cases where the flow is without stagnation points.

1732645,"We present NLTE abundances of CNO for a sample of four O9 stars in the Galaxy, together with new determinations of their stellar parameters, $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, $\epsilon$(He) and microturbulence. These new analyses take into account the effect of {\it line--blocking} in the spectral synthesis with our classical NLTE, plane--parallel and hydrostatic model atmospheres. The sample includes three O9 He normal stars: two dwarfs, HD 214680 and HD 34078, and one supergiant, HD 209975, and one fast rotating giant with a preliminary high He overabundance, HD 191423 with $\epsilon$(He)=0.20. We find first that the consideration of microturbulence in the spectral synthesis for the fast rotator leads to a considerably lower He abundance, $\epsilon$(He)=0.12. The CNO abundances of the three He normal stars are in good agreement with the values in the literature for Galactic B dwarfs with no evidence of mixing, and show that they all have the same chemical composition. We also discuss however the possible CNO contamination of the supergiant HD 209975. For the fast rotator we find that the abundances show the trend of the CNO contamination: a N overabundance together with C and O depletion. The N/C and N/O ratios of our stars as a function of their projected rotational velocities are consistent with the predictions of the recent evolutionary models of Meynet & Maeder [Mey&Mae00].

1732646,"In Europe (e.g., in Italy), and in the States, the opinion is widely spreading that the negative consequences of modern progress are the fault of ""Science"". A lively debate on this topic took place among the famous writer Leonardo Sciascia and Italian physicists like Edoardo Amaldi and Emilio Segre', when Sciascia wrote his known book about the disappearance of Ettore Majorana, a book that presented Majorana (a very reserved theoretical physicist) as an example of the scientist that keeps his discoveries secret when afraid of possible evil applications. We wish to contribute now to such a question, since many special meetings did recently return to it, while celebrating the centenary of Majorana's birth (2006), or 30 years (2005) from Sciascia's book publication. It appeared natural to us to start with the figure of Einstein, who, even if extremely peaceable, supported the atomic bomb construction by his letter to Roosvelt. We discuss first the significance of part of Einsteins's scientific work (which flourished in particular one century ago): We seize this opportunity for presenting a derivation of the ""twins paradox"", so simple that it has been taught to Senior High School last-year students or University undergraduate students; all the present work, more in general, is addressed mainly to them. In the second part of this paper, we analyse the general meaning of Einstein's contributions to philosophy and pedagogy. The third part is entirely devoted to our main subject, i.e., to discussing the ""Responsibility of the Intellectuals"". The reader interested chiefly in this last part, can find it re-expounded in a self-contained way in the Appendix. More information in the Contents of this article."
1732647,"PSR B0943+10 is known to show remarkably stable drifting subpulses, which can be interpreted in terms of a circumferential motion of 20 sparks, each completing one circulation around the periphery of the polar cap in 37 pulsar periods. We use this observational constraint and argue that the vacuum gap model can adequately describe the observed drift patterns. Further we demonstrate that {\em only} the presence of strong non-dipolar surface magnetic field can favor such vacuum gap formation. Subsequently, for the first time we are able to constrain the parameters of the surface magnetic field, and model the expected magnetic structure on the polar cap of PSR B0943+10 considering the inverse Compton scattering photon dominated vacuum gap.

1732648,"There is empirical evidence that the two-point correlation function of the galaxy distribution follows, for small scales, reasonably well a power-law expression ξ(r) / αr^−γ with γ between 1.5 and 1.9. Nevertheless, most of the point eld models suggested in the literature do not have this property. This paper presents a new class of models, which is produced by modifying point elds commonly used in cosmology to mimic the galaxy distribution, but where γ = 2 is too large. The points are independently and randomly shifted, leading to the desired reduction of the value of γ. Martinez Garcia, Vicente, Vicent.Martínez@uv.es"
1732649,"We analyze new high-resolution Chandra X-ray images of the Wolf-Rayet binary system WR147. This system contains a WN8 star with an early-type companion located 0.6'' to its north, and is the only known early-type binary with a separation on the sky large enough for the wind-wind collision between the stars to currently be resolved at X-ray energies. The 5 ksec Chandra HRC-I image provides the first direct evidence for spatially extended X-ray emission in an early-type binary system. The X-ray emission peaks close to the position of the radio bow shock and north of the WN8 star. A deeper X-ray image is needed to accurately determine the degree of spatial extension, to exactly align the X-ray and optical/radio frames, and to determine whether part of the detected X-ray emission arises in the individual stellar winds. Simulated X-ray images of the wind-wind collision have a FWHM consistent with the data, and maximum likelihood fits suggest that a deeper observation may also constrain the inclination and wind momentum ratio of this system. However, as the WR wind dominates the colliding wind X-ray emission it appears unlikely that the mass-loss rate and the terminal velocity of the companion wind can be separately determined from X-ray observations. We also note an inconsistency between numerical and analytical estimates of the X-ray luminosity ratio of the stronger and weaker wind components, and conclude that the analytical results are in error.

1732652,"We describe a high-precision radial velocity search for jovian-mass companions to main sequence stars in the Hyades star cluster. The Hyades provides an extremely well controlled sample of stars of the same age, the same metallicity, and a common birth and early dynamical environment. This sample allows us to explore the dependence of the process of planet formation on only a single independent variable: the stellar mass. In this paper we describe the survey and summarize results for the first five years. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures; To appear in the July 2002 issue of The Astronomical Journal"
1732653,"The Hyades constitute a homogeneous sample of stars ideal for investigating the dependence of planet formation on the mass of the central star. Due to their youth, Hyades members are much more chromospherically active than stars traditionally surveyed for planets using high precision radial velocity (RV) techniques. Therefore, we have conducted a detailed investigation of whether magnetic activity of our Hyades target stars will interfere with our ability to make precise RV searches for substellar companions. We measure chromospheric activity (which we take as a proxy for magnetic activity) by computing the equivalent of the R'HK activity index from the Ca II K line. <R'HK> is not constant in the Hyades: we confirm that it decreases with increasing temperature in the F stars, and also find it decreases for stars cooler than mid-K. We examine correlations between simultaneously measured R'HK and RV using both a classical statistical test and a Bayesian odds ratio test. We find that there is a significant correlation between R'HK and the RV in only 5 of the 82 stars in this sample. Thus, simple Rprime HK-RV correlations will generally not be effective in correcting the measured RV values for the effects of magnetic activity in the Hyades. We argue that this implies long timescale activity variations (of order a few years; i.e., magnetic cycles or growth and decay of plage regions) will not significantly hinder our search for planets in the Hyades if the stars are closely monitored for chromospheric activity. The trends in the RV scatter (sigma'_v) with <R'HK>, vsini, and P_rot for our stars is generally consistent with those found in field stars in the Lick planet search data, with the notable exception of a shallower dependence of sigma'_v on <R'HK> for F stars.

1732654,"We outline the construction of an updated version of the New Luyten Two-Tenths (NLTT) catalog of high proper motion stars, which will contain improved astrometry and photometry for the vast majority of the ~59,000 stars in NLTT. The bright end is constructed by matching NLTT stars to Hipparcos, Tycho-2, and Starnet; the faint end by matching to USNO-A and 2MASS. In this first paper, we detail the bright-end matching procedure. We show that for the majority of stars in his catalog, Luyten measured positions accurate to 1"" even though he recorded his results much more coarsely. However, there is a long tail of position errors, with one error as large as 11 deg. Proper-motion errors for the stars with small position errors are 24 mas/yr (1 sigma) but deteriorate to 34 mas/yr for stars with inferior positions. NLTT is virtually 100% complete for V<11.5 and |b|>15 deg, but completeness in this magnitude range falls to about 75% at the Galactic plane. Incompleteness near the plane is not uniform, but is rather concentrated in the interval -80<l<20, where the Milky Way is brightest. Comment: Submitted to ApJ, 28 pages including 7 figures"
1732655,"We discuss a novel cold dark matter candidate which is formed from the ordinary quarks during the QCD phase transition when the axion domain wall undergoes an unchecked collapse due to the tension in the wall. If a large number of quarks is trapped inside the bulk of a closed axion domain wall, the collapse stops due to the internal Fermi pressure. In this case the system in the bulk, may reach the critical density when it undergoes a phase transition to a color superconducting phase with the ground state being the quark condensate, similar to BCS theory. If this happens, the new state of matter representing the diquark condensate with a large baryon number B ≥ 1020 becomes a stable soliton-like configuration. Consequently, it may serve as a novel cold dark matter candidate."
1732656,"We report the discovery with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope of 65 ms radio pulsations from the X-ray pulsar J0205+6449 at the center of supernova remnant 3C 58, making this possibly the youngest radio pulsar known. From our observations at frequencies of 820 and 1375 MHz, the free-electron column density to PSR J0205+6449 is found to be 140.7 +/- 0.3 cm(-3) pc. The barycentric pulsar period P and period derivative (P) over dot determined from a phase-coherent timing solution are consistent with the values previously measured from X-ray observations. The averaged radio profile of PSR J0205+6449 consists of one sharp pulse of width approximate to3 ms approximate to0.05P. The pulsar is an exceedingly weak radio source, with a pulse-averaged flux density in the 1400 MHz band of similar to45 muJy and a spectral index of similar to-2.1.

1732657,"We present a catalog of J-band (1.08 um to 1.35 um) stellar spectra at low resolution (R ~ 400). The targets consist of 105 stars ranging in spectral type from O9.5 to M7 and luminosity classes I through V. The relatively featureless spectra of hot stars, earlier than A4, can be used to remove the atmospheric features which dominate ground-based J-band spectroscopy. We measure equivalent widths for three absorption lines and nine blended features which we identify in the spectra. Using detailed comparison with higher resolution spectra, we demonstrate that low resolution data can be used for stellar classification, since several features depend on the effective temperature and gravity. For example The CN index (1.096 - 1.104 um) decreases with temperature, but the strength of a blended feature at 1.28 um (consisting of primarily P beta) increases. The slope of a star's spectrum can also be used to estimate its effective temperature. The luminosity class of a star correlates with the ratio of the Mg I (1.1831 um) line to a blend of several species at 1.16 um. Using these indicators, a star can be classified to within several subclasses. Fifteen stars with particularly high and low metal abundances are included in the catalog and some spectral dependence on metal abundance is also found.

1732658,"We derive the distribution of the dimensionless specific angular momentum of dark matter halos, $P(j)$, in the framework of the standard tidal torque theory, and explain the characteristic shape of $P(j)$ commonly observed in N-body simulations. A scalar quantity (shear scalar), $r$, is introduced for measuring the effective strength of the tidal torque force acting upon the halo from the surrounding matter. It is found that the ubiquitous and broad shape of $P(j)$ can mostly be attributed to the unique property of the shear scalar $r$, and also that $P(j)$ is insensitve to the underlying collapse dynamics. Our result demonstrates that although the shape of $P(j)$ is ubiquitous and close to log-normal, the distribution is not exactly log-normal but decays exponentially at the high angular momentum end, and drops slowly as a power-law with an index 2 at the low angular momentum end.

1732659,"We examine what types of galaxies the conversion formula from dust infrared (IR) luminosity into the star formation rate (SFR) derived by Kennicutt (1998) is applicable to. The ratio of the observed IR luminosity, $L_{\rm IR}$, to the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the newly ($\la$ 10 Myr) formed stars, $L_{\rm SF}$, of a galaxy can be determined by a mean dust opacity in the interstellar medium and the activity of the current star formation. We find that these parameters area being $0.5 \le L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm SF} \le 2.0$ is very large, and many nearby normal and active star-forming galaxies really fall in this area. It results from offsetting two effects of a small dust opacity and a large cirrus contribution of normal galaxies relative to starburst galaxies on the conversion of the stellar emission into the dust IR emission. In conclusion, the SFR determined from the IR luminosity under the assumption of $L_{\rm IR}=L_{\rm SF}$ like Kennicutt (1998) is reliable within a factor of 2 for all galaxies except for dust rich but quiescent galaxies and extremely dust poor galaxies.

1732660,"We investigate a novel mechanism of bulk acceleration for relativistic jets of pure electron-positron pair plasma.We assumed that relativistically hot plasma is optically thick for Compton scattering and then pair plasma coupled dynamically to photons may establish quasi-Wien equilibria. We name such an electron-positron pair plasma the ""Wien-fireball"". Assuming there is a Wien-fireball, it is easy to form highly relativistic jets not only because coupled photons do not cause radiation drag effect, but also because coupled photons prevent catastrophic annihilation of pair plasma. It is found that the Wien-fireball provides a very effective mechanism to form high power jets. And the radiation of the Wien-fireball in blazars should be observed as MeV peaked emission at infinity with an order of kinetic power of jets. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted in ApJ"
1732661,"We studied the energy spectrum and the large-scale fluctuation of the X-ray background with the ASCA GIS based on the ASCA MSS and LSS observations. A total of 91 fields with Galactic latitude |b|>10 deg were selected with a sky coverage of 50 deg^2 and 4.2 Ms of exposure. For each field, sources brighter than \sim 2\times 10^{-13}\ergs (2-10 keV) were eliminated. Spectral fits with a single power-law model for the individual 0.7-10 keV spectra showed a significant excess below \sim 2 keV, which could be expressed by an additional thermal model with kT\simeq 0.4 keV or a steep power-law model with photon index GS\simeq 6. The 0.5-2 keV intensities of the soft thermal component varied significantly by 1\sigma=52^{+4}_{-5}%, and showed a maximum toward the Galactic Center. This component is considered to be entirely Galactic. As for the hard power-law component, an average photon index of 91 fields was obtained to be GH = 1.412\pm 0.007\pm 0.025 and the average 2-10 keV intensity was calculated as FH = (6.38\pm 0.04\pm 0.64)\times 10^{-8} \ergss. The Galactic component is marginally detected in the hard band. The 2-10 keV intensities shows a 1\sigma deviation of 6.49^{+0.56}_{-0.61}%, while deviation due to the NXB is 3.2%. The observed deviation can be explained by the Poisson noise of source count in the f.o.v. (\sim 0.5 deg^2), even assuming a single \logn relation on the whole sky. Based on the observed fluctuation and the absolute intensity, an acceptable region of the \logn relation was derived, showing a consistent feature with the recent Chandra and XMM-Newton results. Fluctuation of the spectral index was also examined, and it implied a large amount of hard sources and a substantial variation in the intrinsic source spectra (GS\simeq 1.1\pm 1.0)."
1732662,"The solar system gas giant planets are oblate due to their rapid rotation. A measurement of the planet's projected oblateness would constrain the planet's rotational period. Planets that are synchronously rotating with their orbital revolution will be rotating too slowly to be significantly oblate; these include planets with orbital semimajor axes 0.2 AU (for MP ~ MJupiter and M* ~ M☉). Jupiter-like planets in the range of orbital semimajor axis 0.1 to 0.2 AU will tidally evolve to synchronous rotation on a timescale similar to main-sequence stars' lifetimes. In this case, an oblateness detection will help constrain the planet's tidal Q value. The projected oblateness of a transiting extrasolar giant planet is measurable from a very high photometric precision transit light curve. For a Sun-sized star and a Jupiter-sized planet, the normalized flux difference in the transit ingress/egress light curve between a spherical and an oblate planet is a few to 15 × 10⁻⁵ for oblateness similar to Jupiter and Saturn, respectively. The transit ingress and egress are asymmetric for an oblate planet with orbital inclination different from 90° and a nonzero projected obliquity. A photometric precision of 10⁻⁴ has been reached by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the known transiting extrasolar planet HD 209458b. Kepler, a NASA discovery-class mission designed to detect transiting Earth-sized planets, requires a photometric precision of 10⁻⁵ and expects to find 30 to 40 transiting giant planets with orbital semimajor axes <1 AU, about 20 of which will be at >0.2 AU. Furthermore, part-per-million photometric precision (reached after averaging over several orbital periods) is expected from three other space telescopes to be launched within the next three years.

The spectrum shows bright lines of H, He I, and He II, all moving with a period of 0.059712(1) d, which we interpret as the orbital period. The star's brightness varies with a strict period of 515.0592(2) s, and a mean full amplitude of 0.11 mag. These properties qualify it as a /bona fide/ DQ Herculis star (intermediate polar) -- in which the magnetism of the rapidly rotating white dwarf channels accretion flow to the surface. Normally at V=17.8, the star shows rare and very brief outbursts to V=12-13. We observed one in December 2001, and found that the 515 s pulse amplitude had increased by a factor of ~100 (in flux units). A transient orbital signal may also have appeared.

1732664,"The nonlinear stability domain of Lagrange's celebrated 1772 solution of a three-body problem is obtained numerically as a function of the masses of the bodies and the common eccentricity of their Keplerian orbits. This domain shows that this solution may be realized in extra-solar planetary systems similar to those that have been discovered recently with two Jupiter-size planets orbiting a solar-size star. For an exact 1:1 resonance, the Doppler shift variation in the emitted light would be the same as for stars which have only a single planetary companion. But it is more likely that in actual extra-solar planetary systems there are deviations from such a resonance, raising the interesting prospect that Lagrange's solution can be identified by an analysis of the observations. The existence of another stable 1:1 resonance solution which would have a more unambiguous Doppler shift signature is also discussed."
1732665,"If the high-energy emission from TeV blazars is produced by the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) mechanism, then simultaneous X-ray and Gamma-ray observations of these objects are a powerful probe of the electron (and/or positron) populations responsible for this emission. Understanding the emitting particle distributions and their evolution in turn allow us to probe physical conditions in the inner blazar jet and test, for example, various acceleration scenarios. By constraining the SSC emission model parameters, such observations also allow us to predict the intrinsic (unabsorbed) Gamma-ray spectra of these sources, a major uncertainty in current attempts to use the observed Gamma-ray spectra to constrain the intensity of the extragalactic background at optical/infrared wavelengths. As a next step in testing the SSC model and as a demonstration of the potential power of coordinated X-ray and Gamma-ray observations, we attempt to model in detail the X-ray and Gamma-ray light curves of the TeV Blazar Mrk 501 during its April-May 1997 outburst using a time dependent SSC emission model. Extensive, quasi-simultaneous X-ray and gamma-ray coverage exists for this period. We discuss and explore quantitatively several of the flare scenarios presented in the literature. We show that simple two-component models (with a soft, steady X-ray component plus a variable SSC component) involving substantial pre-acceleration of electrons to Lorentz factors on the order of 1E+5 describe the data train surprisingly well. All considered models imply an emission region that is strongly out of equipartition and low radiative efficiencies (ratio between kinetic jet luminosity and comoving radiative luminosity) of 1 per-mill and less."
1732666,"We construct a speculative scenario for the evolution of Wolf-Rayet central stars of planetary nebula. It is clear from the latest infra-red observations that a new perspective has to be adopted: the simultaneous presence of carbon- and oxygen-rich dust (double dust chemistry), while being a rare phenomenon for H-rich central stars, is found around the vast majority of cool Wolf-Rayet central stars. This correlation between Wolf-Rayet characteristics and double dust chemistry points to a common mechanism. Within the binary evolution framework established by Soker, two scenarios are proposed, responsible for the majority (80-85%) and minority (15-20%) of Wolf-Rayet central stars. In the first scenario, proposed here for the first time, a low mass main sequence star, brown dwarf or planet spirals into the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star inducing extra mixing, hence a chemistry change, and terminating the AGB evolution. In the second scenario, previously proposed, a close binary companion is responsible for the formation of a disk around either the binary or the companion. This long-lived disk harbors the O-rich dust. Comment: PASP, in press; 21 pages"
1732667,"Globular clusters as $\omega$ Cen and NGC 2808 appear to have a population of very He-rich stars. From a theoretical point of view, one expects the presence of He-rich stars in all globular clusters showing an oxygen-sodium (O-Na) anticorrelation. In this paper, we briefly recall how fast rotating massive stars could be the main source of the material from which He-rich stars have formed. We speculate that the UV-upturn phenomenon observed in all elliptical galaxies might be due to He-rich stars. If this hypothesis is correct then fast rotating massive stars may have played in the early evolutionary phases of these systems a similar role as the one they played in the nascent globular clusters."
1732668,"We have compiled a new sample of galaxies with published catalogs of HII region coordinates. This sample, together with the former catalog of Garcia-Gomez and Athanassoula (1991) will form the basis for subsequent studies of the spiral structure in disc galaxies. In this paper we address the problem of the deprojection of the galaxy images. For this purpose we use two deprojection methods based on the HII region distribution and compare the results with the values found in the literature using other deprojection methods. Taking into account the results of all the methods, we propose optimum values for the position and inclination angles of all the galaxies in our sample. Comment: TeX file with 16 postscript figures"
1732669,"The upper limit of the effective surface temperature of the neutron star (NS) PSR J0205+6449 in the supernova remnant 3C 58 obtained recently by Slane et al. (2002) is analyzed using a modern theory of NS cooling (Kaminker et al. 2002). The observational limit can be explained by cooling of a superfluid NS with the core composed of neutrons, protons and electrons, where direct Urca process is forbidden. However, combined with the data on the surface temperatures of other isolated NSs, it gives evidence (emphasized by Slane et al.) that direct Urca process is open in the inner cores of massive NSs. This evidence turns out to be less stringent than the evidence provided by the well known observations of Vela and Geminga. Comment: 3 pages, 2 figures, AA Letters (submitted)"
1732670,"We present three spectra of Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard state from 3-1000 keV produced with RXTE and OSSE. We demonstrate that a pure thermal Comptonization model, with Compton reflection fits the data well, with coronal temperatures of about 90 keV, optical depths of about 1.3, and reflection fractions of about 0.25 $\times$ 2$\pi$. We find that no additional components are necessary to fit the data, although the presence of an additional non-thermal component does result in a marginal improvement to the goodness of the fit. Two of the observations are fit better by an almost purely non-thermal Comptonization model with $\Gamma_{inj}$ of $\sim$ 3.2 for the electrons and the other parameters essentially the same as for the thermal model, while the third observation is also consistent with this model. Observations that could break this degeneracy are discussed. We also demonstrate that the low reflection parameter (i.e. $R/2\pi<1$) is due to a lack of strong curvature in the 30-50 keV range of the spectrum and not due to ionization effects. The spectrum changes very little over the three weeks of the observations, in accordance with a three week correlation timescale found in the All Sky Monitor data. We show that for a purely thermal corona, the radius of the corona must be between $3\times 10^6$ and $1.5\times 10^{10}$ cm, while the radius of a hybrid corona or a purely non-thermal corona is constrained to be between $10^8$ and $10^9$ cm."
1732671,"We investigate which shocked wind is responsible for the majority of the X-ray emission in colliding wind binaries, an issue where there is some confusion in the literature, and which we show is more complicated than has been assumed. We find that where both winds rapidly cool (typically close binaries), the ratio of the wind speeds is often more important than the momentum ratio, because it controls the energy flux ratio, and the faster wind is generally the dominant emitter. When both winds are largely adiabatic (typically long-period binaries), the slower and denser wind will cool faster and the stronger wind generally dominates the X-ray luminosity.

1732672,"On January 10 and 13, 2001, Venus was observed for the first time with an X-ray astronomy satellite. The observation, performed with the ACIS-I and LETG/ACIS-S instruments on Chandra, yielded data of high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Venus is clearly detected as a half-lit crescent, with considerable brightening on the sunward limb. The morphology agrees well with that expected from fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays in the planetary atmosphere. The radiation is observed at discrete energies, mainly at the O-K_alpha energy of 0.53 keV. Fluorescent radiation is also detected from C-K_alpha at 0.28 keV and, marginally, from N-K_alpha at 0.40 keV. An additional emission line is indicated at 0.29 keV, which might be the signature of the C 1s --> pi* transition in CO_2 and CO. Evidence for temporal variability of the X-ray flux was found at the 2.6 sigma level, with fluctuations by factors of a few times indicated on time scales of minutes. All these findings are fully consistent with fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays. No other source of X-ray emission was detected, in particular none from charge exchange interactions between highly charged heavy solar wind ions and atmospheric neutrals, the dominant process for the X-ray emission of comets. This is in agreement with the sensitivity of the observation. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures"
1732673,"The Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey is a sensitive survey of a strip of the Galactic plane with |b| < 5° and 260° < l < 50° at 1374 MHz. Here we report the discovery of 120 new pulsars and subsequent timing observations, primarily using the 76-m Lovell radio telescope at Jodrell Bank. The main features of the sample of 370 published pulsars discovered during the multibeam survey are described. Furthermore, we highlight two pulsars: PSR J1734−3333, a young pulsar with the second highest surface magnetic field strength among the known radio pulsars, Bs= 5.4 × 1013 G, and PSR J1830−1135, the second slowest radio pulsar known, with a 6-s period."
1732674,"The formation and evolution of galactic disks are complex phenomena, where gas and star dynamics are coupled through star formation and the related feedback. The physical processes are so numerous and intricate that numerical models focus, in general, on one or a few of them only. We propose here a numerical model with particular attention to the multiphase nature of the interstellar medium; we consider a warm gas phase (> 10^4 K), treated as a continuous fluid by an SPH algorithm, and a cold gas phase (down to 10K), fragmented in clouds, treated by a low-dissipation sticky particles component. The two gas phases do not have the same dynamics, nor the same spatial distribution. In addition to gravity, they are coupled through mass exchanges due to heating/cooling processes, and supernovae feedback. Stars form out of the cold phase, and re-inject mass to the warm phase through SN explosions and stellar winds. The baryons are embedded in a live cold dark matter component. Baryonic disks, initially composed of pure gas, encounter violent instabilities, and a rapid phase of star formation, that slows down exponentially. Stars form in big clumps, that accumulate in the center to build a bulge. Exponential metallicity gradients are obtained. External infall of gas should be included to maintain a star formation rate in the disk comparable to what is observed in present disk galaxies. Comment: 15 pages. Accepted for publication in A&A"
1732675,"We present the analysis of Infrared Space Observatory long-wavelength spectrometer (LWS) observations of the two nearby late-type galaxies NGC 1313 and NGC 6946. Both galaxies have been fully mapped in the [C II] far-infrared fine-structure line at 158 μm, and some regions have been observed also in the [O I] 63 μm and [N II] 122 μm lines. We use these observations to derive the physical properties of the atomic interstellar medium, to establish how they relate to other interstellar medium components (gas and dust), and to establish how they vary with different galaxy components such as nucleus, spiral arms, and disk. The [C II] line is the main cooling line of the atomic medium. In NGC 6946 and NGC 1313, its emission represents 0.8% of the infrared emission. Moreover, the [C II] emission can be spatially associated with three components: the nucleus, the star-forming regions in spiral arms, and the diffuse galaxy disk. This last component contributes 40% in NGC 6946 and ~30% in NGC 1313 to the total emission. We apply the photodissociation region (PDR) model by Kaufman et al. to derive PDR physical parameters responsible for the neutral atomic gas emission (G0, n, and Ts). The results do not significantly differ from what Malhotra et al. recently found by modeling the integrated emission of a sample of 60 normal galaxies. This suggests that the emission in each region under the LWS beam in NGC 6946 and NGC 1313 (corresponding to a linear size of ~1.5 kpc) is likely to arise from a mixture of components similar to the mixture producing the integrated emission of normal galaxies. However, some regions in NGC 6946 have a G0/n ratio ~2–3 times smaller than the mean value found for the normal galaxy sample (1.3), suggesting that the beam-averaged contribution of a less active component in these regions is higher than its contribution in the integrated emission of normal galaxies or, conversely, that the bulk of the integrated emission of the normal galaxies is dominated by a few active regions probably located in their nuclei. CO(1–0) and [C II] in NGC 6946 are well correlated, and the mean [C II]/CO ratio agrees with the mean integrated ratios of the normal galaxies sample. This value (~500) is a factor of ~2 less than the mean ratio found for a sample of normal galaxies observed with the Kupier Airborne Observatory (KAO) by Stacey et al. This difference is probably due to the fact that the KAO beam (55'') is smaller than the LWS beam (75''), such that the Stacey et al. KAO observations are likely to be more biased toward the nucleus of the galaxies and therefore toward more active regions. In NGC 1313 only four LWS regions have been observed in CO(1–0), and three of them were detected. The [C II]/CO(1–0) seems to systematically increase from the northeast to the south, along the S-shaped spiral arm, indicating that the interstellar medium conditions in NGC 1313 are much more inhomogeneous than the conditions in NGC 6946. H I and [C II] in NGC 6946 are completely uncorrelated, probably because they arise from different gas components: [C II] arises principally in dense and warm PDR and H I from diffuse (n 3 × 103 cm-3) gas. On the other hand, in NGC 1313 we successfully detect two distinct gas components: a cirrus-like component, for which H I and [C II] are weakly correlated as observed in our Galaxy, and a component associated with dense PDRs completely uncorrelated from H I as observed in NGC 6946. Finally, we find that the H I residing in dense gas surrounding the star-forming regions and presumably recently photodissociated constitutes a few percent of the total H I. In turn, this dense gas component produces most of the [C II] emission emitted by the atomic neutral medium, even if its contribution is lower in NGC 1313 than in NGC 6946. On the other hand, the [C II] emission arising from ionized gas is higher in NGC 1313 than in NGC 6946."
1732676,"Results of 3-month continuous monitoring of turbulence profile and seeing at Cerro Tololo (Chile) in May-July 2002 are presented. Some 28000 low-resolution profiles were measured by a new MASS single-star turbulence monitor, accompanied by seeing data from DIMM. The median seeing was 0.95 arcseconds. The first 500 m contribute 60% to the total seeing, the free-atmosphere median seeing was 0.55 arcseconds. Free-atmosphere seeing is almost never better than 0.15 arcseconds because there is always some turbulence above 12 km. A 4-day period of calm upper atmosphere with a stable free-atmosphere seeing of 0.2-0.3 arcseconds was noted. A gain in resolution from adaptive compensation of ground layer will be 1.7 times typically and 2-3 times during such calm periods. Correlations of the free-atmosphere turbulence with the wind speed at tropopause and of the ground-layer turbulence with ground wind are studied. Temporal evolution of turbulence is characterized by recurrent bursts, their typical duration increases from 15 minutes in low layers to 1-2 hours in high layers. The large data base of turbulence profiles can be used to test meso-scale modeling of astronomical seeing. Comment: Submitted to MNRAS 7 pages, 10 figures"
1732677,"The pn camera of EPIC is inherently robust against radiation damage effects. Nevertheless, the knowledge of charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) of the pn camera is crucial for obtaining the correct energy scale. We describe detailed in-orbit monitoring of this effect, utilizing the internal calibration source. We find that during the first two years in orbit the CTI increased by about 4% for Al-K and by about 7% for Mn-K. The increases in the CTI are well within expectations, with no measurable effect on the energy resolution."
1732678,"We show that a straightforward application of the predicted relation connecting the absolute K magnitude of fundamental RR Lyrae variables to their period and metal content, together with current evolutionary predictions on the mass and luminosity of Horizontal Branch stars, supply a distance estimate to the prototype star RR Lyr in close agreement with the recent parallax determination by HST (Benedict et al. 2002), largely unaffected by the interstellar extinction correction. Adopting =0.12+-0.10 mag as a safe estimate of the extinction correction to RR Lyr, we obtain a ""pulsation"" parallax of 3.858+-0.131 mas which agrees quite well, and with a smaller formal error, with the HST measurement (3.82+-0.20 mas) and with the weighted average of HST, Hipparcos, and ground-based determinations (3.87+-0.19 mas). This result suggests that near-infrared magnitudes and pulsation models could constrain the distance to well-studied RR Lyrae stars, both in the field and in globular clusters, with an accuracy better than current direct trigonometric measurements.

1732679,"We present a CSO and BIMA molecular line survey of the dense, quiescent molecular environment ahead of HH2. The molecular gas is cold, 13 K, and moderately dense, 3x10^5 cm^-3. A total of 14 species has been detected (including different isotopes and deuterated species). The relative abundances of the clump are compared with other dense molecular environments, including quiescent dark clouds, and active low and high mass star forming regions. This comparison confirms the peculiar chemical composition of the quiescent gas irradiated by the HH objects. Thus, from this comparison, we found that the HCO+, CH3OH and H2CO are strongly enhanced. SO and SO2 are weakly enhanced, whereas HCN and CS are underabundant. The CN abundance is within the range of value found in starless dark clouds, but it is low with respect to high mass star forming regions. Finally, the chemical composition of HH2 confirms the qualitative results of the Viti & Williams (1999) complex chemical model that follows the chemical behavior of a molecular clump irradiated by a HH object.

1732680,"We present the results of measurements of the solar neutrino capture rate in gallium metal by the Russian-American Gallium Experiment SAGE during slightly more than half of a 22-year cycle of solar activity. Combined analysis of the data of 92 runs during the 12-year period January 1990 through December 2001 gives a capture rate of solar neutrinos with energy more than 233 keV of 70.8 +5.3/-5.2 (stat.) +3.7/-3.2 (syst.) SNU. This represents only slightly more than half of the predicted standard solar model rate of 128 SNU. We give the results of new runs beginning in April 1998 and the results of combined analysis of all runs since 1990 during yearly, monthly, and bimonthly periods. Using a simple analysis of the SAGE results combined with those from all other solar neutrino experiments, we estimate the electron neutrino pp flux that reaches the Earth to be (4.6 +/- 1.1) E10/(cm^2-s). Assuming that neutrinos oscillate to active flavors the pp neutrino flux emitted in the solar fusion reaction is approximately (7.7 +/- 1.8) E10/(cm^2-s), in agreement with the standard solar model calculation of (5.95 +/- 0.06) E10/(cm^2-s)."
1732681,"The force acting on a test particle moving around a body that is gravitating and emitting electromagnetic radiation at the same time is computed up to the second order in $1/c$, and the shift of perihelion is found. The total shift is positive (the perihelion moves in the direction of particle revolution) and it increases from zero to infinity as the radiation pressure to gravity ratio increases from zero to 1. The additional shift caused by the radiation pressure contains a term inversely proportional to eccentricity, therefore it may dominate over the general relativistic shift if the orbit is round enough."
1732682,"We present the results of a massive variability search based on a photometric survey of a six square degree region along the Galactic plane at ($l = 305^\circ$, $b = -0.8^\circ$) and ($l = 330^\circ$, $b = -2.5^\circ$). This survey was performed in the framework of the EROS II (Exp\'erience de Recherche d'Objets Sombres) microlensing program. The variable stars were found among 1,913,576 stars that were monitored between April and June 1998 in two passbands, with an average of 60 measurements. A new period-search technique is proposed which makes use of a statistical variable that characterizes the overall regularity of the flux versus phase diagram. This method is well suited when the photometric data are unevenly distributed in time, as is our case. 1,362 objects whose luminosity varies were selected. Among them we identified 9 Cepheids, 19 RR Lyrae, 34 Miras, 176 eclipsing binaries and 266 Semi-Regular stars. Most of them are newly identified objects. The cross-identification with known catalogues has been performed. The mean distance of the RR Lyrae is estimated to be $\sim 4.9 \pm 0.3$ kpc undergoing an average absorption of $\sim 3.4 \pm 0.2$ magnitudes. This distance is in good agreement with the one of disc stars which contribute to the microlensing source star population.Our catalogue and light curves are available electronically from the CDS, Strasbourg and from our Web site http://eros.in2p3.fr.

1732683,"We use HST broad band images, VLA and VLBI continuum data to study the three dimensional orientation of jets relative to nuclear dust disks in 20 radio galaxies. The comparison between the position angles of the jets with those of the dust disks major axes shows a wide distribution, suggesting that they are not aligned preferentially perpendicular to each other. We use a statistical technique to determine the 3 dimensional distribution of angles between jets and dust disks rotation axes. This analysis shows that the observations are consistent with jets homogeneously distributed over a large region, extending over polar caps of 55 degrees to 77 degrees, but seem to avoid lying close to the plane of the dust disks. We argue that the lack of close alignment between jets and dust disks axes is not likely to be caused by feeding the nucleus with gas from mergers originated from random directions. We suggest that the misalignment can be due by a warping mechanism in the accretion disk, like self-irradiation instability or the Bardeen-Petterson effect, or that the gravitational potential in the inner regions of the galaxy is misaligned with respect to that of the dust disk.

1732684,"Q0957+561A,B is a double-imaged quasar that has been intensively observed during the last 10 years in different optical bands and with several telescopes, and we concentrated on recent public data obtained at the Apache Point Observatory (APO) and the Teide Observatory (TO). When an intrinsic event appears in the light curve of Q0957+561A, its twin event (a similar feature) is seen in the brightness record of Q0957+561B, and thus, one can measure the corresponding time delay. The TO dataset includes two prominent twin events, which were detected with a time separation of 425 +/- 4 days. On the other hand, from the APO dataset, we found a clear evidence for two different time delays associated with two pairs of twin events: 417.0 +/- 0.6 (APO main twin events) and 432.0 +/- 1.9 days (APO secondary twin events), where the APO(main)-APO(secondary) difference delay is of - 15 +/- 2 days. In agreement with the Yonehara's idea, if the three pairs of twin events are originated inside a standard hybrid source (accretion disk and circumnuclear stellar region), the three measured time delays indicate that they do not come from a common zone in the source. Therefore, we can consider that the prominent features are caused by flares in a standard hybrid source and discuss on the size and nature of the region of flares. In this paper it is showed that the more plausible interpretation is that two of the three flares are generated at distances (from the central black hole) larger than 90 pc. Some stellar scenarios can explain the two flares far away from the black hole, while phenomena in the accretion disk cannot cause them. Comment: MNRAS, in press (LaTeX, 16 pages, 7 eps figures)"
1732685,"We simulate the future evolution of the observed inhomogeneities in the local universe assuming that the global expansion rate is dominated by a cosmological constant. We find that within two Hubble times (∼30 billion years) from the present epoch, large-scale structures will freeze in co-moving coordinates and the mass distribution of bound objects will stop evolving. The Local Group will get somewhat closer to the Virgo cluster in co-moving coordinates, but will be pulled away from the Virgo in physical coordinates due to the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In the distant future there will only be one massive galaxy within our event horizon, namely the merger product of the Andromeda and the Milky Way galaxies. All galaxies that are not gravitationally bound to the Local Group will recede away from us and eventually exit from our event horizon. More generally, we identify the critical interior overdensity above which a shell of matter around an object will remain bound to it at late times."
1732686,"The advent of high-resolution cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments now allows studies on the temperature fluctuations at scales corresponding to a few arcminutes and below. Though the reported excess power at ˜2000-6000 by CBI and BIMA is roughly consistent with a secondary contribution resulting from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, this requires a higher normalization for the matter power spectrum than measured by other means. In addition to a local redshift contribution, another strong possibility for anisotropies at very small scales involves nonstandard aspects of inflationary models. To distinguish between contributions from early universe and local structures, including a potential point source contribution, and to understand the extent to which structures at low redshifts contribute to small-scale temperature anisotropies, it may be necessary to perform a combined study involving CMB and the large-scale structure. We suggest a cross correlation of the temperature data with a map of the large-scale structure, such as the galaxy distribution. For next generation small angular scale CMB experiments, multifrequency observations may be a necessary aspect to allow an additional possibility to distinguish between these different scenarios."
1732687,"We present preliminary results of a 25 ks XMM-Newton observation of the largest sample of Extremely Red Objects (EROs) available to date (about 450 sources), selected in a contiguous area of 700 arcmin^2 (Daddi et al. 2000). Five of the 36 hard X-ray selected sources brighter than 7x10^{-15} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} in the 2-10 keV band are associated with EROs. All of the X-ray detected EROs show rather extreme X-ray-to-optical flux ratios, suggesting the presence of highly obscured AGN activity."
1732688,"NGC 1333, a highly active star formation region within the Perseus molecular cloud complex, has been observed with the ACIS-I detector on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. In our image with a sensitivity limit of ~ 1e28 erg/s, we detect 127 X-ray sources, of which, 95 are known cluster members. The X-ray luminosity function of the discovered YSO population spans a range of 1e28-3.2e31 erg/s in the 0.5-8 keV band. Comparison with K-band source counts indicates that we detect all of the known cluster members with K < 12, and about half of members with K > 12. We detect seven X-ray emitting YSOs which drive optically visible jets as well as one deeply embedded object that has not been detected in near-IR observations. The presence or absence of an outflows does not appear to produce any difference in X-ray properties of YSOs. We also find no systematic differences in X-ray luminosity distributions between two complete subsamples of CTTs and WTTs. That suggests that there is no difference in the astrophysical mechanism of WTT and CTT X-ray emission production. Additional results include: the X-ray emission from two late-B stars which illuminate the reflection nebula originates from unresolved late-type companions; two T Tauri stars are discovered as previously unknown components of visual binaries; and the X-ray counterpart of SVS 16 has the column density much lower than that expected from near-IR photometry and thus its X-ray luminosity is not anomalously high, as has been previously suggested.

This extension could reflect the double nature of the QSO, as seen in the optical, or could be diffuse emission with a (redshift-corrected) mean brightness temperature of 2.8 K for the CO (2-1) line. We find that CO excitation conditions are lower than in two other IR-luminous z > 4 QSOs, suggesting the presence of a significant contribution from cooler, lower density molecular gas [n(H-2) similar to 5 x 10(3) cm(3), although such a conclusion is complicated by the possibility of differential gravitational magnification."
1732690,"We study the structure and properties of hot MHD accretion onto a Kerr black hole. In such a system, the hole is magnetically coupled to the inflowing gas and exerts a torque onto the accretion flow. A hot settling flow can form around the hole and transport the angular momentum outward, to the outer edge of the flow. Unlike other hot flows, such as advection- and convection-dominated flows and inflow-outflow solutions (ADAFs, CDAFs, and ADIOS), the properties of the hot settling flow are determined by the spin of the central black hole, but are insensitive to the mass accretion rate. Therefore, it may be possible to identify rapidly spinning BHs simply from their broad-band spectra. Observationally, the hot settling flow around a Kerr hole is somewhat similar to other hot flows in that they all have hard, power-law spectra and relatively low luminosities. Thus, most black hole candidates in the low/hard and, perhaps, intermediate X-ray state may potentially accrete via the hot settling flow. However, a settling flow will be somewhat more luminous than ADAFs/CDAFs/ADIOS, will exhibit high variability in X-rays, and may have relativistic jets. This suggests that galactic microquasars and active galactic nuclei may be powered by hot settling flows. We identify several galactic X-ray sources as the best candidates."
1732691,"We carried out a search for M-type Vega-like stars by correlating the IRAS Faint Source Catalog with Hipparcos selected M-type stars. Three stars with apparent IRAS 25mu excess emission are shown instead to be non-IR-excess stars from ground-based 11.7 and 17.9mu photometry. Two stars previously suggested to have Vega-like mid-IR excess are also shown to be non-excess stars. These results imply that other suggested mid-IR excess stars in the literature may also be false excess stars. Detection threshold bias is apparently responsible for these bogus IR excesses. Sixty micron excess emission from a previously known M-type Vega-like star (GJ 803) is identified again. Comment: 3 figures, 1 table. Accepted in AJ"
1732692,"Radiation dominated accretion disks are likely to be subject to the ``photon bubble'' instability, which may lead to strong density inhomogeneities on scales much shorter than the disk scale height. Such disks -- and magnetized, radiation-dominated atmospheres in general -- could radiate well above the Eddington limit without being disrupted. When density contrasts become large over distances of order the photon mean free path, radiative transfer cannot be described adequately using either the standard diffusion approximation or existing prescriptions for flux-limited diffusion. Using analytical and Monte Carlo techniques, we consider the effects of strong density gradients deep within radiation- and scattering-dominated atmospheres. We find that radiation viscosity -- i.e., the off-diagonal elements of the radiation stress tensor -- has an important effect on radiative transfer under such conditions. We compare analytical and numerical results in the specific case of a plane-parallel density wave structure and calculate Eddington enhancement factors due to the porosity of the atmosphere. Our results can be applied to the study of dynamical coupling between radiation forces and density inhomogeneities in radiation dominated accretion disks in two or three dimensions.

1732693,"We present new hard X-ray spectra of three radio-loud AGNs of moderately high X-ray luminosity (L_x ~ 10^45 erg/s; PKS 2349-01, 3C 323.1, and 4C 74.26) obtained with ASCA and BeppoSAX. The X-ray continua are described in all three cases with a power law model with photon indices of Gamma~1.85, modified at low energies by absorption in excess of the Galactic, which appears to be due to neutral gas. At higher energies, an Fe Ka emission line is detected in PKS 2349-01 and 4C 74.26, and is tentatively detected in 3C 323.1. The equivalent widths of the lines are consistent, albeit within large uncertainties, with the values for radio-quiet AGN of comparable X-ray luminosity. The Fe Ka line is unresolved in 4C 74.26. In the case of PKS 2349-01, however, the inferred properties of the line depend on the model adopted for the continuum: if a simple power-law model is used, the line is resolved at more than 99% confidence with a full width at half maximum corresponding to approximately 50,000 km/s and a rest-frame equivalent width of 230 +/- 120 eV, but if a Compton ""reflection"" model is used the line is found to be a factor of 2 weaker, for an assumed full width at half maximum of 50,000 km/s. In 4C 74.26, a strong Compton ""reflection"" component is detected. Its strength suggests that the scattering medium subtends a solid angle of 2pi to the illuminating source. Overall, the spectral indices of these radio-loud quasars are remarkably similar to those of their radio-quiet counterparts. On the other hand, if the absorber is indeed neutral, as our results suggest, this would be consistent with the typical properties of radio-loud AGNs.

1732694,"We show that bipartite concurrence for rank-2 mixed states of qubits is written by an observable which can be exactly and directly measurable in experiment by local projective measurements, provided that four copies of the composite quantum system are available. In addition, for a tripartite quantum pure state of qubits, the 3-tangle is also shown to be measurable only by projective measurements on the reduced density matrices of a pair of qubits conditioned on four copies of the state.

1732695,"We make a quantitative prediction for the detection rate of orphan GRB afterglows as a function of flux sensitivity in X-ray, optical, and radio wavebands, based on a recent model of collimated GRB afterglows. We find that the orphan afterglow rate strongly depends on the opening angle of the jet (roughly \propto \theta_jet^{-2}), as expected from simple geometrical consideration, if the total jet energy is kept constant as suggested by recent studies. The relative beaming factor b_rel, i.e., the ratio of all afterglow rate including orphans to those associated with observable prompt GRBs, could be as high as b_rel >~ 100 for searches deeper than R ~ 24, depending on afterglow parameters. To make the most plausible predictions, we average the model emission for ten sets of afterglow parameters obtained through fits to ten well-observed, collimated GRB jets, weighted by the sky coverage of each jet. Our model expectations are consistent with the results (or constraints) obtained by all past searches. We estimate the number of orphan afterglows in the first 1500deg^2 field of the SDSS to be about 0.2. The relative beaming factor b_rel is rapidly increasing with the search sensitivity: b_rel ~ 3 for the SDSS sensitivity to transient objects in the northern sky (R ~ 19), ~14 for the past high-z supernova searches (R ~ 23), and ~50 for the sensitivity of the Subaru Suprime-Cam (R ~ 26). Predictions are made for the current facilities and future projects in X-ray, optical, and radio bands. Among them, the southern-sky observation of the SDSS (sensitive to transients down to R ~ 23) could detect ~40 orphan afterglows during the five-year operation. Allen Telescope Array would find about 200 afterglows in a radio band at ~0.1-1mJy with b_rel ~ 15. Comment: Accepted to ApJ after minor changes. The afterglow sample is extended, and the predicted numbers are changed but only slightly. Received Apr 5, Accepted May 8"
1732696,"Classical single-mode fiber interferometers, using one fiber per aperture, have very limited imaging capabilities and small field of view. Observations of extended sources (resolved by one aperture) cannot be fully corrected for wavefront aberrations: accurate measurements of object visibilities are then made very difficult from ground-based fiber interferometers. These limitations are very severe for the new generation of interferometers, which make use of large telescopes equipped with adaptive optics, but can be overcome by using several fibers per aperture. This technique improves the wide field imaging capabilities of both ground-based and space interferometers. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures. Accepted for publication in A&A"
1732697,"We review recent progress on the modeling and use of reflection spectra from irradiated and ionized accretion discs. On the computational side, calculations of reflection spectra from discs with non-uniform density structure have shown that thermal instabilities can effect the predictions. Ionized reflection spectra have been used effectively in fitting data of Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies, and have placed constraints on the strength and shape of soft X-ray emission lines."
1732698,"We report the results of the XMM-Newton observation of the Pulsar Wind Nebula (PWN) in the composite supernova remnant G0.9+0.1 located in the Galactic Center region. Thanks to the sensitivity of the EPIC cameras, we focus on the first spectral analysis of large and small-scale structures of this PWN using MOS and PN data in combination. Our spatially resolved spectral analysis at large-scale offers a clear indication of a softening of the photon index with distance from the centroid of the nebula (from Gamma_{core}=1.12^{+0.45}_{-0.48} to Gamma=2.42^{+0.19}_{-0.19}), as observed in other known X-ray plerions. A spectral analysis of the small-scale structures in the central region of this PWN, delineates variations of the spectral index within the arc-like feature observed with Chandra: the eastern part has a hard photon index (Gamma ~ 1.2 pm 0.5), while the south-west part has a softer photon index (Gamma ~ 2.8 pm 0.7)."
1732699,"We have developed a Monte Carlo method to compute the luminosity function of galaxies, based on photometric redshifts, which takes into account the non-gaussianity of the probability functions, and the presence of degenerate solutions in redshift. In this paper we describe the method and the mock tests performed to check its reliability. The NIR luminosity functions and the redshift distributions are determined for near infrared subsamples on the HDF-N and HDF-S. The results on the evolution of the NIR LF, the stellar mass function, and the luminosity density, are presented and discussed in view of the implications for the galaxy formation models. The main results are the lack of substantial evolution of the bright end of the NIR LF and the absence of decline of the luminosity density up to a redshift z ~ 2, implying that most of the stellar population in massive galaxies was already in place at such redshift.

1732700,"We propose a simple physical model which describes dephasing in the electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer at filling factor nu=2 . This model explains very recent experimental results, such as the unusual lobe-type structure in the visibility of Aharonov-Bohm oscillations, phase rigidity, and the asymmetry of the visibility as a function of transparencies of quantum point contacts. According to our model, dephasing in the interferometer originates from strong Coulomb interaction at the edge of two-dimensional electron gas. The long-range character of the interaction leads to a separation of the spectrum of edge excitations on slow and fast mode. These modes are excited by electron tunneling and carry away the phase information. The new energy scale associated with the slow mode determines the temperature dependence of the visibility and the period of its oscillations as a function of voltage bias. Moreover, the variation of the lobe structure from one experiment to another is explained by specific charging effects, which are different in all experiments. We propose to use a strongly asymmetric Mach-Zehnder interferometer with one arm being much shorter than the other for the spectroscopy of quantum Hall edge states."

We construct an effective Lagrangian with $D^{*}D_1$ contact interactions constrained by the heavy quark symmetry and chiral symmetry to study Z(4430). We find that if Z(4430) is a $D^{*}D_1$ molecule state, there should be a $B^{*}B_1$ bound state as well, and it mass is about 11048.6 MeV."

1732705,"On January 10 and 13, 2001, Venus was observed for the first time with an X-ray astronomy satellite. The observation, performed with the ACIS-I and LETG/ACIS-S instruments on Chandra, yielded data of high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Venus is clearly detected as a half-lit crescent, with considerable brightening on the sunward limb. The morphology agrees well with that expected from fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays in the planetary atmosphere. The radiation is observed at discrete energies, mainly at the O-K_alpha energy of 0.53 keV. Fluorescent radiation is also detected from C-K_alpha at 0.28 keV and, marginally, from N-K_alpha at 0.40 keV. An additional emission line is indicated at 0.29 keV, which might be the signature of the C 1s --> pi* transition in CO_2 and CO. Evidence for temporal variability of the X-ray flux was found at the 2.6 sigma level, with fluctuations by factors of a few times indicated on time scales of minutes. All these findings are fully consistent with fluorescent scattering of solar X-rays. No other source of X-ray emission was detected, in particular none from charge exchange interactions between highly charged heavy solar wind ions and atmospheric neutrals, the dominant process for the X-ray emission of comets. This is in agreement with the sensitivity of the observation. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures"
1732706,"We present results of the search for variable stars in the field of young open cluster NGC 581. Based on 19 nights of observations, 6 new variable stars were discovered. Two of them turned out to be eclipsing binary systems. Another two detected variable stars are most probably of gamma Dor type. During our observations one of the known Be stars located in our field of view showed irregular variations of brightness, typical for this class of stars. The sixth variable star is a pulsating red giant."

1732708,"Using the facilities of the KASCADE Central Detector EAS muon arrival time distributions, observed with reference to the arrival time of the first locally registered muon, and their correlations with other EAS observables have been experimentally investigated. The experimental data enable a study of the sensitivity of such local arrival time distributions to the mass composition of cosmic rays in the energy region around the knee. For that purpose, nonparametric multivariate even-by-event analyses have been performed specified by three different mass groups for an estimate of the mass composition. It turns out that local muon arrival time distributions display a minor sensitivity to the mass of the EAS inducing particle, at least for distances from the shower axis R < 100m. The measurements comprise a subset of all EAS events registered by KASCADE due to the observation conditions of the arrival time distributions, with a threshold of the muon energy E = 2.4 GeV and a minimum multiplicity n for being accepted in the observed data samples. By studying the event acceptance in the registered samples on basis of Monte Carlo simulations a test of the consistency of the Monte Carlo simulations with the data is enabled. Within the present uncertainties the results of such a test show a remarkable agreement of the experimental findings with the Monte Carlo simulations, using the QGSJET model as generator of the high-energy hadronic interactions."
1732709,"We present observations of the X-ray halo around the low-mass X-ray binary GX 13+1 from the Chandra X-ray telescope. The halo is caused by scattering in interstellar dust grains, and we use it to diagnose the line-of-sight position, size distribution, and density of the grains. Using the intrinsic energy resolution of Chandra's ACIS CCDs and the recent calibration observation of the Chandra point-spread function, we were able to extract the halo fraction as a function of energy and off-axis angle. We define a new quantity, the ""halo coefficient,"" or the total halo intensity relative to the source extrapolated to 1 keV, and measure it to be 1.5 for GX 13+1. We find a relationship between this value and the dust size, density, and hydrogen column density along the line of sight to GX 13+1. We also conclude that our data do not agree with ""fluffy"" dust models that earlier X-ray halo observations have supported and that models including an additional large dust grain population are not supported by these data."

1732711,"We present interstellar scintillation velocity measurements for four millisecond pulsars obtained from long-term monitoring observations with the Arecibo radio telescope at 430 MHz. We also derive explicit expressions that relate the measured scintillation velocity to the effective transverse velocity responsible for the motion of the diffraction pattern for both binary and solitary pulsars. For B1257+12, B1534+12, J1640+2224, and J1713+0747 we derive velocity estimates of 197, 192, 38, and 82 km/s, respectively. These values are in good agreement with proper motion measurements for the four pulsars. For PSR B1534+12, we use the ISS velocity dependence on orbital phase to determine the longitude of the ascending node (Omega) of the pulsar's orbit and to derive an estimate of the effective scattering screen location. The two possible values of Omega are 70+/-20 and 290+/-20 degrees and the approximate screen location is 630+/-200 pc with the assumed pulsar distance of 1.1 kpc.

1732712,"We present a new technique based on fixed delay interferometry for high-throughput, high-precision, and multiobject Doppler radial velocity (RV) surveys for extrasolar planets. The Doppler measurements are conducted by monitoring the stellar fringe phase shifts of the interferometer instead of absorption-line centroid shifts as in state-of-the-art echelle spectroscopy. High Doppler sensitivity is achieved through optimizing the optical delay in the interferometer and reducing photon noise by measuring multiple fringes over a broad band. This broadband operation is performed by coupling the interferometer with a low- to medium-resolution postdisperser. The resulting fringing spectra over the bandpass are recorded on a two-dimensional detector, with fringes sampled in the slit spatial direction and the spectrum sampled in the dispersion direction. The resulting total Doppler sensitivity is, in theory, independent of the dispersing power of the postdisperser, which allows for the development of new-generation RV machines with much reduced size, high stability, and low cost compared to echelles. This technique has the potential to improve RV survey efficiency by 2-3 orders of magnitude over the cross-dispersed echelle spectroscopy approach, which would allow a full-sky RV survey of hundreds of thousands of stars for planets, brown dwarfs, and stellar companions once the instrument is operated as a multiobject instrument and is optimized for high throughput. The simple interferometer response potentially allows this technique to be operated at other wavelengths independent of popular iodine reference sources, being actively used in most of the current echelles for Doppler planet searches, to search for planets around early-type stars, white dwarfs, and M, L, and T dwarfs for the first time. The high throughput of this instrument could also allow investigation of extragalactic objects for RV variations at high precision."
1732713,"We report the discovery of a spatially-resolved edge-on protoplanetary disk in the ~2-Myr-old MBM 12 young association. Our near-infrared images of LkHa 263C (MBM 12A 3C), obtained with the Hokupa'a adaptive optics system on the Gemini North telescope, clearly show two elongated reflection nebulosities separated by a dark lane, a morphology well-matched by scattered light models of an optically thick (at near-infrared wavelengths) edge-on disk. An optical spectrum of the scattered light nebulosity obtained with the Keck II telescope exhibits a spectral type of M0 +/- 0.5 (T_eff = 3850 +/- 100 K) for the central star and contains H_alpha and forbidden emission lines, which may indicate the presence of a jet. The absence of a near-infrared point source implies A_K > 9.5 toward the unseen central star. The disk is flared and has a radius of ~150 AU (at a distance of 275 pc) and an inclination of 87 degrees. The aspect ratio of the model disk in the J-band is 0.72. There is possible evidence for dust settling to the disk midplane. LkHa 263C is 4.115"" from the 0.415"" binary LkHa 263 A and B (MBM 12A 3A and 3B), which is itself 15.5"" from LkHa 262 (MBM 12A 2). Thus, LkHa 263C may be the first disk to be clearly resolved around an individual star in a young quadruple system. The detection of a faint edge-on disk near a bright star demonstrates both the high angular resolution and the high sensitivity that can be achieved with adaptive optics imaging on large telescopes.

1732714,"Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we quantitatively investigate the constraints on a 10 dimensional space of cosmological parameters which may be obtained with future cluster surveys. We explore the dependence of the Omega_m constraint on both angular coverage and depth of field. We show that in each case there is a natural cutoff beyond which the constraints on Omega_m do not significantly improve. We also investigate the sensitivity of the constraints to changes in our knowledge of the Mass-Temperature (M-T) relation by including its normalization and scatter as two of the parameters in the Fisher matrix. To make our analysis more realistic, we have added, as priors, the Fisher matrices from hypothetical supernova and CMB experiments. We find that X-ray cluster surveys actually help to constrain the M-T relation, and explore the implications of this result."
1732715,"We describe a Faraday-rotation structure in the Interstellar Medium detected through polarimetric imaging at 1420 MHz from the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey (CGPS). The structure, at l=91.8, b=-2.5, has an extent of ~2 degree, within which polarization angle varies smoothly over a range of ~100 degree. Polarized intensity also varies smoothly, showing a central peak within an outer shell. This region is in sharp contrast to its surroundings, where low-level chaotic polarization structure occurs on arcminute scales. The Faraday-rotation structure has no counterpart in radio total intensity, and is unrelated to known objects along the line of sight, which include a Lynds Bright Nebula, LBN 416, and the star cluster M39 (NGC7092). It is interpreted as a smooth enhancement of electron density. The absence of a counterpart, either in optical emission or in total intensity, establishes a lower limit to its distance. An upper limit is determined by the strong beam depolarization in this direction. At a probable distance of 350 +/- 50 pc, the size of the object is 10 pc, the enhancement of electron density is 1.7 cm-3, and the mass of ionized gas is 23 M_sun. It has a very smooth internal magnetic field of strength 3 microG, slightly enhanced above the ambient field. G91.8-2.5 is the second such object to be discovered in the CGPS, and it seems likely that such structures are common in the Magneto-Ionic Medium. Comment: 16 pages, 5 figures, ApJ accepted"
1732716,"We study numerically the cooling of a young bare strange star and show that its thermal luminosity, mostly due to e(+)e(-) pair production from the quark surface, may be much higher than the Eddington limit. The mean energy of photons far from the strange star is approximately 10(2) keV or even more. This differs both qualitatively and quantitatively from the thermal emission from neutron stars and provides a definite observational signature for bare strange stars. It is shown that the energy gap of superconducting quark matter may be estimated from the light curves if it is in the range from approximately 0.5 MeV to a few MeV."
1732717,"We present new Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFPC2 imagery and STIS long-slit spectroscopy of the planetary nebula NGC 7009. The primary goal was to obtain high spatial resolution of the intrinsic line ratio [O iii] 4364/5008 and thereby evaluate the electron temperature (Te) and the fractional mean-square Te variation (tA2)across the nebula. The WFPC2 Te map is rather uniform; almost all values are between 9000–11 000 K, with the higher Te values closely coinciding with the inner He++ zone. The results indicate very small values–≲0.01– for tA2 throughout. Our STIS data allow an even more direct determination of Te and tA2, albeit for a much smaller area than with WFPC2. We present results from binning the data along the slit into tiles that are 0.5-arcsec square (matching the slit width). The average [O iii] temperature using 45 tiles (excluding the central star and STIS fiducial bars) is 10 139 K; tA2 is 0.0035. The measurements of Te reported here are an average along each line of sight. Therefore, despite finding remarkably low tA2, we cannot completely rule out temperature fluctuations along the line of sight as the cause of the large abundance discrepancy between heavy element abundances inferred from collisionally excited emission lines compared to those derived from recombination lines."
1732718,"We consider density fluctuations of a two-fluid model consisting of hydrogen plasma and radiation prior to the cosmic hydrogen recombination. As investigation method that of the dispersion relations is applied, which have been derived from the general-relativistic sound-wave equations taking into account the coupling between plasma and radiation carefully. We obtain growing unstable acoustic modes within the mass range 2 · 106M ⊙< M < 6 · 10 12M ⊙. In a second step the coupled differential equations for the amplitudes of the unstable modes are integrated numerically with respect to time where the integration extends from the initial time prior to the hydrogen recombination up to the present time. We find a significant increase of the amplitudes up to 4 orders of magnitude, if the Universe is described by a cosmological model with a positive cosmological constant (Λ ≃ 2,2 · 10-56 cm-2) and a positive curvature (Lemaître-Universe) without an essential amount of cold dark matter. We conclude that the existence of galaxies confirm these statements."
1732719,"As part of the HST/STIS GRB host survey program we present the detection of three faint gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxies based on an accurate localisation using ground-based data of the optical afterglows (OAs). A common property of these three hosts is their extreme faintness. The location at which GRBs occur with respect to their host galaxies and surrounding environments are robust indicators of the nature of GRB progenitors. The bursts studied here are among the four most extreme outliers, in terms of relative distance from the host center, in the recent comprehensive study of Bloom et al. 2002. We obtain a revised and much higher probability that the galaxies identified as hosts indeed are related to the GRBs (P(n_chance)=0.78, following Bloom et al. 2002), thereby strengthening the conclusion that GRBs are preferentially located in star-forming regions in their hosts. Apart from being faint, the three hosts consist of multiple structures, indicative of merging and active star-formation. For one of the hosts, GRB 980329, we estimate a photometric redshift of z~3.5."
1732720,"The results of a multisite photometric campaign of θ2 Tau are reported. This binary system consists of an evolved and a main-sequence A star, both situated inside the instability strip. The 12th Delta Scuti Network campaign included 152 h of high-precision photometry obtained at four observatories. This leads to the derivation of 11 frequencies of pulsation in the 10.8 to 14.6 cycle d−1 range. These frequencies confirm the results from previous Earth-based (1982–1986) as well as satellite (2000) photometry, although amplitude variability on a time-scale of several years is present. We show that at least two high frequencies (26.18 and 26.73 cycle d−1) are also present in θ2 Tau. Arguments are given that these high frequencies originate in the main-sequence companion and are not combination frequencies, fi+fj, from the primary. Models for both the primary and the secondary components were checked for the instability against radial and non-radial oscillations. All hot models of the primary with Teff > 8000 K are stable in the observed frequency range. The best fit between the theoretical and observed frequency ranges is achieved for models with Teff≈ 7800 K (or slightly higher), in agreement with photometric calibrations. The instability range spans two or three radial orders in the range p4 to p6 for radial modes. Post-main-sequence models (with or without overshooting) are preferable for the primary, but main-sequence models with overshooting cannot be excluded. For the less-luminous secondary component the instability range is wider and spans 5 to 7 radial orders from p2 to p8. The observed frequencies lie around radial modes p5 to p6. The main uncertainties of these results are caused by a simple treatment of the convective flux in the hydrogen ionization zone."
1732721,"Gravitational lensing will cause a dispersion in the Hubble diagram for high redshift sources.

1732722,"In this paper we present detailed models of the vertical structure (temperature and density) of passive irradiated circumstellar disks around T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars. In contrast to earlier work, we use full frequency- and angle-dependent radiative transfer instead of the usual moment equations. We find that this improvement of the radiative transfer has strong influence on the resulting vertical structure of the disk, with differences in temperature as large as 70 %. However, the spectral energy distribution (SED) is only mildly affected by this change. In fact, the SED compares reasonably well with that of improved versions of the Chiang & Goldreich (CG) model. This shows that the latter is a reasonable model for the SED, in spite of its simplicity. It also shows that from the SED alone, little can be learned about the vertical structure of a passive circumstellar disk. The molecular line emission from these disks is more sensitive to the vertical temperature and density structure, and we show as an example how the intensity and profiles of various CO lines depend on the adopted disk model. The models presented in this paper can also serve as the basis of theoretical studies of e.g. dust coagulation and settling in disks. Comment: 12 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"
1732723,"Spatially resolved photocurrent measurements on carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) operated in various transport regimes are reported. It is demonstrated that the photocurrents measured at different biasing conditions provide access to the electronic band structure profile of the nanotube channel. A comparison of the profiles with the device switched into n- or p-type states clearly evidences the impact of chemical doping from the ambient. Moreover, we show that scanning photocurrent microscopy constitutes an effective and facile technique for the quantitative determination of the Schottky barrier height in such devices."
1732724,"This paper deals with some classical problems about the projective geometry of complex algebraic curves. We call locally toric a projective curve that in a neighbourhood of every point has a local analytical parametrization of type , with a1, …, an relatively prime positive integers. In this paper we prove that the general tangent line to a locally toric curve in P3 meets the curve only at the point of tangency. More generally, under mild hypotesis, up to a finite number of anomalous parametrizations , the general osculating 2-space to a locally toric curve of genus g < 2 in P4 does not meet the curve again. The arithmetic part of the proof of this result relies on the results contained in the Appendix.

Comparing our result with the experimental one of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8, we find that the experimentally observed isotopic band shift in ARPES is due to the off-diagonal quadratic e-ph coupling, whereas the presence of e-e repulsion partially suppresses this effect."
1732726,"The dynamics of activation waves in excitable media can give rise to spiral turbulence, the resulting spatiotemporal chaos being associated with empirical biological phenomena such as life-threatening disturbances in the natural rhythm of the heart. In this paper, we propose a spatially extended but non-global scheme using an array of control points for terminating such spatiotemporally chaotic excitations. A low-amplitude control signal is applied sequentially at each point on the array, resulting in a traveling wave of excitation in the underlying medium which drives away the turbulent activity. Our method is robust even in the presence of significant heterogeneities in the medium, which have often been an impediment to the success of other control schemes."
1732727,"Consider a local chain Differential Graded algebra, such as the singular chain complex of a pathwise connected topological group.In two previous papers, a number of homological results were proved for such an algebra: An Amplitude Inequality, an Auslander–Buchsbaum Equality, and a Gap Theorem. These were inspired by homological ring theory.By the so-called looking glass principle, one would expect that analogous results exist for simply connected cochain Differential Graded algebras, such as the singular cochain complex of a simply connected topological space.Indeed, this paper establishes such analogous results."
1732728,"We study the theoretical signature of magnetic masses on the light curve of the gravitational microlensing effect in NUT space. The light curves for microlensing events in NUT space are presented and contrasted with those caused by lensing produced by normal matter. In the next step, associating the magnetic mass to the massive astrophysical compact halo objects (MACHOs), we try to see the effect on the light curves of microlensing candidates observed by the MACHO group. The presence or absence of this feature in the observed microlensing events can shed light on the question of the existence of magnetic masses in the Universe."
1732729,"Using pulse timing observations we have obtained precise parameters, including positions with about 20 mas accuracy, of five millisecond pulsars in NGC 6752. Three of them, located relatively close to the cluster center, have line-of-sight accelerations larger than the maximum value predicted by the central mass density derived from optical observation, providing dynamical evidence for a central mass-to-light ratio >~ 10, much higher than for any other globular cluster. It is likely that the other two millisecond pulsars have been ejected out of the core to their present locations at 1.4 and 3.3 half-mass radii, respectively, suggesting unusual non-thermal dynamics in the cluster core.

Star counts from deep K-band images from the CFHT are presented, and compared with results from the 2MASS survey and some Galaxy models. With appropriate corrections for detector artifacts and galaxies, the data agree with the models down to K~18, but indicate a larger population of fainter red stars. There is also a significant population of compact galaxies that extend to the observational faint limit of K=20.5.

1732731,"(abridged) We present high-resolution echelle spectroscopy of a photometricaly-selected sample if thirty-nine dwarfs with spectral types between M6.5 and L0.5. Two stars, 2MASSI 0253202+271333 and 2MASSW 0952219-192431, are double-lined spectroscopic binaries. We have used our observations to search for Li I 6708 A absorption, characteristic of sub-stellar mass; estimate the level of chromospheric activity through measurement of H-alpha emission fluxes; measure rotational velocities via line broadening; and determine radial velocities and Galactic space motions. Two dwarfs have strong lithium absorption, the previously-known brown dwarf, LP 944-20, and 2MASSI J0335020+234235, which we identify as a probable 0.06 M_sun brown dwarf, age ~1 Gyr. We have investigated the prospect of using the observed frequency of lithium absorption amongst ultracool M dwarfs (M7 to M9.5) as a probe of the initial mass function. The available observations are difficult to reconcile with Salpeter-like power-law mass functions (alpha > 2) for masses below 0.1M_Sun. A comparison between the rotational velocities and -alpha fluxes shows no evidence for significant correlation. Velocity dispersions are significantly lower than those measured for nearby M dwarfs, but show remarkable similarity to results for earlier-type emission-line (dMe) dwarfs. The latter are generally assigned ages of less than ~3 Gyrs."
1732732,"Hickson Compact Group (HCG) 31, consisting of the Wolf-Rayet galaxy NGC 1741 and its irregular dwarf companions, was observed using the Infrared Space Observatory. The deconvolved ISOCAM maps of the galaxies using the 7.7 micron and 14.3 micron (LW6 and LW3) filters are presented, along with ISOPHOT spectrometry of the central starburst region of NGC 1741 and the nucleus of galaxy HCG 31A. Strong mid-IR emission was detected from the central burst in NGC 1741, along with strong PAH features and a blend of features including [S IV] at 10.5 micron. The 14.3/6.75 micron flux ratio, where the 6.75 micron flux was synthesized from the PHT-S spectrum, and 14.3/7.7 micron flux ratios suggest that the central burst within NGC 1741 may be moving towards the post-starburst phase. Diagnostic tools including the ratio of the integrated PAH luminosity to the 40 to 120 micron infrared luminosity and the far-infrared colours reveal that despite the high surface brightness of the nucleus, the properties of NGC 1741 can be explained in terms of a starburst and do not require the presence of an AGN. The Tycho catalogue star TYC 04758-466-1, with m$_{V}$ = 11.3 and spectral type F6, was detected at 7.7 and 14.3 microns. Comment: 27 pages, 7 figures.

1732733,"Statistical properties of the interplanetary magnetic field fluctuations can provide an important insight into the solar wind turbulent cascade. Recently, analysis of the Probability Density Functions (PDF) of the velocity and magnetic field fluctuations has shown that these exhibit non-Gaussian properties on small time scales while large scale features appear to be uncorrelated. Here we apply the finite size scaling technique to explore the scaling of the magnetic field energy density fluctuations as seen by WIND. We find a single scaling sufficient to collapse the curves over the entire investigated range. The rescaled PDF follow a non Gaussian distribution with asymptotic behavior well described by the Gamma distribution arising from a finite range Lévy walk. Such mono scaling suggests that a Fokker-Planck approach can be applied to study the PDF dynamics. These results strongly suggest the existence of a common, nonlinear process on the time scale up to 26 hours."
1732734,"We describe an axisymmetric general relativistic code for rotational core collapse. The code evolves the coupled system of metric and fluid equations using the ADM 3+1 formalism and a conformally flat metric approximation of the Einstein equations. Within this approximation the ADM 3+1 equations reduce to a set of five coupled non-linear elliptic equations for the metric components. The equations are discretized on a 2D grid in spherical polar coordinates and are solved by means of a Newton-Raphson iteration using a block elimination scheme to solve the diagonally dominant, sparse linear system arising within each iteration step. The relativistic hydrodynamics equations are formulated as a rst-order flux-conservative hyperbolic system and are integrated using high-resolution shock-capturing schemes based on Riemann solvers. We assess the quality of the conformally flat metric approximation for relativistic core collapse and present a comprehensive set of tests that the code successfully passed. The tests include relativistic shock tubes, the preservation of the rotation pro le and of the equilibrium of rapidly and di erentially rotating neutron stars (approximated as rotating polytropes), spherical relativistic core collapse, and the conservation of rest-mass and angular momentum in dynamic spacetimes. The application of the code to relativistic rotational core collapse, with emphasis on the gravitational waveform signature, is presented in an accompanying paper.

1732735,"We have performed hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic rotational supernova core collapse in axisymmetry and have computed the gravitational radiation emitted by such an event. The Einstein equations are formulated using the conformally flat metric approximation, and the corresponding hydrodynamic equations are written as a first-order flux-conservative hyperbolic system. Details of the methodology and of the numerical code have been given in an accompanying paper. We have simulated the evolution of 26 models in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity. The initial configurations are di erentially rotating relativistic 4=3-polytropes in equilibrium which have a central density of 10^10 g cm^−3. Collapse is initiated by decreasing the adiabatic index to some prescribed fixed value. The equation of state consists of a polytropic and a thermal part for a more realistic treatment of shock waves. Any microphysics like electron capture and neutrino transport is neglected. Our simulations show that the three di erent types of rotational supernova core collapse and gravitational waveforms identified in previous Newtonian simulations (regular collapse, multiple bounce collapse, and rapid collapse) are also present in relativistic gravity. However, rotational core collapse with multiple bounces is only possible in a much narrower parameter range in relativistic gravity. The relativistic models cover almost the same range of gravitational wave amplitudes (4x10^−21 <= h^TT 3x10^−20 for a source at a distance of 10 kpc) and frequencies (60 Hz <= ν <= 1000 Hz) as the corresponding Newtonian ones. Averaged over all models, the total energy radiated in the form of gravitational waves is 8.2 10^−8 Moc^2 in the relativistic case, and 3.6 10^−8 Moc^2 in the Newtonian case. For all collapse models that are of the same type in both Newtonian and relativistic gravity, the gravitational wave signal is of lower amplitude. If the collapse type changes, either weaker or stronger signals are found in the relativistic case. For a given model, relativistic gravity can cause a large increase of the characteristic signal frequency of up to a factor of five, which may have important consequences for the signal detection. Our study implies that the prospects for detection of gravitational wave signals from axisymmetric supernova rotational core collapse do not improve when taking into account relativistic gravity. The gravitational wave signals obtained in our study are within the sensitivity range of the first generation laser interferometer detectors if the source is located within the Local Group.

1732736,"In order to map the three-dimensional location and shape of the emission originating within the accretion stream in AM Her systems, we have investigated the possibilities of relaxing the hitherto-applied constraint of a predetermined stream trajectory in modelling the eclipse profiles. We use emission points which can be located anywhere in the Roche lobe of the primary, together with a regularization term which favours any curved stream structure, connected at the secondary and white dwarf primary. Our results show that, given suitable regularization constraints, such inversion is feasible. We investigate the effect of removing the regularization term, and also the sensitivity of the fit to input parameters such as inclination."
1732737,"A fullerene graph F is a 3-connected plane cubic graph with exactly 12 pentagons and the remaining faces as hexagons. Let M be a perfect matching of F. A cycle C of F is M-alternating if the edges of C appear alternately in and off M. A set $\mathcal{H}$ of disjoint hexagons of F is called a resonant pattern (or sextet pattern) if F has a perfect matching M such that all hexagons in $\mathcal{H}$ are M-alternating. A fullerene graph F is k-resonant if any i ($0\leq i \leq k$) disjoint hexagons of F form a resonant pattern. In this paper, we prove that every hexagon of a fullerene graph is resonant and all leapfrog fullerene graphs are 2-resonant. Further, we show that a 3-resonant fullerene graph has at most 60 vertices and we construct all nine 3-resonant fullerene graphs, which are also k-resonant for every integer $k>3$. Finally, sextet polynomials of the 3-resonant fullerene graphs are computed."
1732738,"In a recent paper (Dai & Lu 1999), we have proposed a simple model in which the steepening in the light curve of the R-band afterglow of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) 990123 is caused by the adiabatic shock which has evolved from an ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a dense medium. We find that such a model is quite consistent with observations if the medium density is about $3\times 10^6 {\rm cm}^{-3}$. Here we discuss this model in more details. In particular, we investigate the effects of synchrotron self absorption and energy injection. A shock in a dense medium becomes nonrelativistic rapidly after a short relativistic phase. The afterglow from the shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at the relativistic stage. Since some models for GRB energy sources predict that a strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during the formation of GRB, we discuss the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativistic shock through magnetic dipole radiation. We find that after the energy which the shock obtains from the pulsar is much more than the initial energy of the shock, the afterglow decay will flatten significantly. When the pulsar energy input effect disappears, the decay will steepen again. These features are in excellent agreement with the afterglows of GRB 980519, GRB 990510 and GRB 980326. Furthermore, our model fits very well all the observational data of GRB 980519 including the last two detections. Comment: 21 pages, LaTeX, accepted for publication in ApJ, one paragraph added"
1732739,"We have analyzed over 2 years of RXTE/ASM data for Cygnus X-1. We have detected the 5.6-day orbital period in Lomb-Scargle periodograms of both light curves and hardness ratios when Cyg X-1 was in the hard state. This detection was made with improved sensitivity and temporal coverage compared with previous detections by other X-ray missions. The folded light curves and hardness ratios show a broad intensity dip accompanied by spectral hardening centered on superior conjunction of the X-ray source. The dip has a duration of about 27% of the orbital period and depth ranging from 8% to 23% of the non-dip intensities in three energy bands. Variability on time scales of hours is often evident within the broad dip in the unfolded data. In contrast, no feature at the orbital period is evident in the periodograms or folded light curves for the soft state. Absorption of X-rays by a stellar wind from the companion star can reproduce the observed X-ray orbital modulations in the hard state. To explain the low orbital modulation in the soft-state data, a reduction of the wind density during the soft state would be required. As an alternative, a partial covering scenario is described which could also account for the lack of the orbital modulation in the soft state."
1732740,"The discovery of strong gamma-ray and hard X-ray emission and the results from various multifrequency campaigns have disclosed new aspects of the blazar phenomenology, leading to a much more robust understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emission, and offering clues for the energetics of their relativistic jets. I review these aspects, and propose that all the diversity in the blazar phenomenology depends on only one parameter. I also suggest that some of the blazar characteristics can be explained by the internal shock scenario, as proposed to explain the emission from gamma-ray bursts."
1732741,"Supernova remnants are expected to contain braided (or stochastic) magnetic fields, which are in some regions directed mainly perpendicular to the shock normal. For particle acceleration due to repeated shock crossings, the transport in the direction of the shock normal is crucial. The mean squared deviation along the shock normal is then proportional to the square root of the time. This kind of anomalous transport is called sub-diffusion. We use a Monte-Carlo method to examine this non-Markovian transport and the acceleration. As a result of this simulation we are able to examine the propagator, density and pitch-angle distribution of accelerated particles, and especially the spectral properties. These are in broad agreement with analytic predictions for both the sub-diffusive and the diffusive regimes, but the steepening of the spectrum predicted when changing from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport is found to be even more pronounced than predicted."

1732743,"We have investigated different scenarios for the origin of the binary millisecond pulsar PSR J1911-5958A in NGC 6752, the most distant pulsar discovered from the core of a globular cluster to date. The hypothesis that it results from a truly primordial binary born in the halo calls for accretion-induced collapse and negligible recoil speed at the moment of neutron star formation. Scattering or exchange interactions off cluster stars are not consistent with both the observed orbital period and its offset position. We show that a binary system of two black holes with (unequal) masses in the range of 3-100 solar masses can live in NGC 6752 until present time and can have propelled PSR J1911-5958A into an eccentric peripheral orbit during the last ~1 Gyr.

1732744,"We have recently written a new code to simulate the long term evolution of spherical clusters of stars. It is based on the pioneering Monte Carlo scheme proposed by Henon in the 70's. Our code has been devised in the specific goal to treat dense galactic nuclei. After having described how we treat relaxation in a first paper, we go on and include further physical ingredients that are mostly pertinent to galactic nuclei, namely the presence of a central (growing) black hole (BH) and collisions between MS stars. Stars that venture too close to the BH are destroyed by the tidal field. This process is a channel to feed the BH and a way to produce accretion flares. Collisions between stars have often been proposed as another mechanism to drive stellar matter into the central BH. To get the best handle on the role of this process in galactic nuclei, we include it with unpreceded realism through the use of a set of more than 10000 collision simulations carried out with a SPH (Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics) code. Stellar evolution has also been introduced in a simple way, similar to what has been done in previous dynamical simulations of galactic nuclei. To ensure that this physics is correctly simulated, we realized a variety of tests whose results are reported here. This unique code, featuring most important physical processes, allows million particle simulations, spanning a Hubble time, in a few CPU days on standard personal computers and provides a wealth of data only rivalized by N-body simulations.

1732745,"We present detailed abundance observations of the metal-poor ([Fe/H] = --2.0) Galactic halo star BD+17 3248. We have detected gold in this star, for the first time in any halo star. We also detected a weak line at 3859.60 A in the spectrum of BD+17 3248 that we tentatively identify with uranium. This would be only the second such detection of this radioactive element in any metal-poor halo stars. Similarly to the case of CS 22892--052, the heavier n-capture elements (Z >= 56) fall on the scaled solar system r-process abundance curve, while the elements with Z = 40--50 in BD+17 3248 fall below that same solar curve. Employing the newly detected Th, U and third r-process peak element (e.g., Pt, Ir) abundances, chronometric age estimates have been made for BD+17 3248. The average value of the various chronometric pairs suggests an age of 13.8 +/- 4 Gyr for this star, consistent, within error limits, with other chronometric age determinations for metal-poor Galactic halo stars."
1732746,"We have analyzed 53 deg2 of RC-band imaging data from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS) and measured the excess correlations in the shapes of galaxies on scales out to ~15. We separate the signal into an ""E"" (lensing) and ""B"" (systematics) mode, which allows us to study the contribution from residual systematics and intrinsic alignments. On scales larger than 10', we find no B mode, suggesting that the signal at those scales is caused solely by gravitational lensing. On smaller scales we find a small but significant B mode. This signal is also present when we select a sample of bright (20 < RC < 22) galaxies. These galaxies are rather insensitive to observational distortions, and we therefore conclude that the observed B mode is likely to be caused by intrinsic alignments. To minimize the effect of intrinsic alignments, we limit the cosmic shear analysis to galaxies with 22 < RC < 24. We derive joint constraints on Ωm and σ8 by marginalizing over Γ, ΩΛ, and the source redshift distribution, using different priors. Marginalizing over Γ and ΩΛ, and using a flat prior for the source redshift distribution, yields a conservative constraint of σ8 = 0.45Ω (95% confidence). A better constraint is derived when we use Gaussian priors for Γ (from the Two-Degree Field survey) and Ωm + ΩΛ (from cosmic microwave background [CMB]), and the source redshift distribution. For this choice of priors, we find σ8 = (0.46)Ω (95% confidence). We also investigated whether the RCS data can be used to constrain Γ. Using our set of Gaussian priors, we find that we can only place a lower bound on Γ for which we find Γ > 0.1 + 0.16Ωm (95% confidence). Comparison of the RCS results with three other recent cosmic shear measurements shows excellent agreement. The current weak-lensing results are also in good agreement with CMB measurements, when we allow the reionization optical depth τ and the spectral index ns to vary. We present a simple demonstration of how the weak-lensing results can be used as a prior in the parameter estimation from CMB measurements to derive constraints on the reionization optical depth τ."
1732747,"We have undertaken a search for variable stars in the metal-rich globular cluster NGC 6388 using time-series BV photometry. Twenty-eight new variables were found in this survey, increasing the total number of variables found near NGC 6388 to ~57. A significant number of the variables are RR Lyrae (~14), most of which are probable cluster members. The periods of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae are shown to be unusually long compared to metal-rich field stars. The existence of these long period RRab stars suggests that the horizontal branch of NGC 6388 is unusually bright. This implies that the metallicity-luminosity relationship for RR Lyrae stars is not universal if the RR Lyrae in NGC 6388 are indeed metal-rich. We consider the alternative possibility that the stars in NGC 6388 may span a range in [Fe/H]. Four candidate Population II Cepheids were also found. If they are members of the cluster, NGC 6388 would be the most metal-rich globular cluster to contain Population II Cepheids. The mean V magnitude of the RR Lyrae is found to be 16.85+/-0.05 resulting in a distance of 9.0 to 10.3 kpc, for a range of assumed values of for RR Lyrae. We determine the reddening of the cluster to be E(B-V)=0.40+/-0.03 mag, with differential reddening across the face of the cluster. We discuss the difficulty in determining the Oosterhoff classification of NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 due to the unusual nature of their RR Lyrae, and address evolutionary constraints on a recent suggestion that they are of Oosterhoff type II.

1732748,"The Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) is a multipurpose instrument which has been delivered by the Instrument Development Laboratory of Lick Observatory for use at the Cassegrain focus of the Keck II telescope. ESI saw first light on August 29, 1999. ESI is a multi-mode instrument that enables the observer to seamlessly switch between three modes during an observation. The three modes of ESI are: An R=13,000-echellette mode; Low-dispersion prismatic mode; Direct imaging mode. ESI contains a unique flexure compensation system which reduces the small instrument flexure to negligible proportions. Long-exposure images on the sky show FWHM spot diameters of 34 microns (0.34"") averaged over the entire field of view. These are the best non-AO images taken in the visible at Keck Observatory to date. Maximum efficiencies are measured to be 28% for the echellette mode and greater than 41% for low-dispersion prismatic mode including atmospheric, telescope and detector losses. In this paper we describe the instrument and its development. We also discuss the performance-testing and some observational results."

1732750,"Despite the importance of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as a fundamental mechanism for angular momentum transport in magnetized accretion disks, it has yet to be demonstrated in the laboratory. A liquid sodium alpha-omega dynamo experiment at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology provides an ideal environment to study the MRI in a rotating metal annulus (Couette flow). A local stability analysis is performed as a function of shear, magnetic field strength, magnetic Reynolds number, and turbulent Prandtl number. The later takes into account the minimum turbulence induced by the formation of an Ekman layer against the rigidly rotating end walls of a cylindrical vessel. Stability conditions are presented and unstable conditions for the sodium experiment are compared with another proposed MRI experiment with liquid gallium. Due to the relatively large magnetic Reynolds number achievable in the sodium experiment, it should be possible to observe the excitation of the MRI for a wide range of wavenumbers and further to observe the transition to the turbulent state.

1732751,"Nowadays, Gravitational lensing is a fundamental toot to study the light propagation in the universe and the evolution of structures. Here, diferent forms of the Santos & Lima smoothness parameter as a funtion of cosmological redshift are used in order to describe various scenarios of evolution of structure. Its effects on the strong gravitational lensing SGL by galaxy cluster dark halos are analized in LCDM, EdS and OCDM cosmologies. The dark matter halos modeled by Navarro-Frenk-White singular profile and the Preses-Schechter approximation is assumed to describe its distribution. We found that SGL probability by galaxy clusters becomes to be sensible to the evolution of structures scenario considered for sources farther than z approximate to 2 and it strongly depends on the cosmology and the smoothness parameter actual value."
1732752,"We have studied the origin of the broad and skewed feature at 4.5–7.5 keV in the energy spectra of NGC 4151 using the ASCA and RXTE data. The feature consists of a narrow peak at 6.4 keV and a broad wing extended between 4.5–7.5 keV. An analysis of the long-term variations revealed that the feature became variable only on a time scale longer than $1.5 \times 10^6 \,\mathrm{s}$. Through a comparison with the continuum variabilities, we found that the emission region of the excess flux at 4.5–7.5 keV has an extent of $10^{17} \,\mathrm{cm}$. The broad and skewed feature at 4.5–7.5 keV may be explained by the so-called “disk-line” model. If so, the size of the line-emitting region, $10^{17} \,\mathrm{cm}$, should be equal to several or ten times the Schwarzschild radius of the central black hole. This results in a black hole mass of $10^{11} \,{{{M}_{\odot}}}$, which may be too large for NGC 4151. We propose an alternative explanation for the broad and skewed feature, i.e. a “reflection” model, which can also reproduce the overall energy spectra very well. In this model, cold matter with a sufficiently large column density is irradiated by X-rays to produce a reflected continuum, which constitutes the broad wing of the feature and narrow fluorescent lines. The equivalent width of the iron fluorescent line ($\sim 2 \,\mathrm{keV}$) and the upper limit of its width ($\sigma < 92 \,\mathrm{eV}$) are also consistent with this model. From these results and considerations, we conclude that the “disk-line” model has difficulty to explain the spectral variations of NGC 4151, and the reflection model is more plausible."
1732753,"We investigate the star-formation history of gas-rich dwarf galaxies, taking account of the dynamical evolution of their neutral hydrogen (H{\sc i}) envelope. Gas-rich dwarfs are classified into blue compact dwarfs (BCDs) and dwarf irregulars (dIrrs). In this paper, their H{\sc i} envelope is clearly shown not to be blown away by their stellar feedback. This is concluded since the observed star-formation rate (SFR) of gas-rich dwarfs is generally smaller than a critical SFR, $\psi_{\rm crit}$, at which stellar feedback accelerates the H{\sc i} envelope to the escape velocity. From this standpoint and the chemical property of sample BCDs, we suggest two possibilities; (1) The H{\sc i} gas in the envelope of BCDs is consumed to fuel their star-formation; and (2) BCDs have a similar star-formation history. We also discuss morphological evolution among dwarf galaxies. As long as gas-rich dwarfs are isolated, it is difficult for them to evolve into dwarf ellipticals (dEs). When the H{\sc i} envelope in gas-rich dwarfs is consumed in subsequent star-formation, a morphological exchange between BCDs and dIrrs is still expected, consistent with previous studies. If the SFR of gas-rich dwarfs was much higher than $\psi_{\rm crit}$ in the past, interestingly, an evolutionary scenario from dEs to gas-rich dwarfs is possible.

1732754,"The radiation of a pulsar wind is computed assuming that at roughly 10 to 100 light cylinder radii from the star, magnetic energy is dissipated into particle energy. The synchrotron emission of heated particles appears periodic, with, in general, both a pulse and an interpulse. The predicted spacing agrees well with the Crab and Vela pulse profiles.Using parameters appropriate for the Crab pulsar (magnetisation parameter at the light cylinder $\sigma=6\times10^4$, Lorentz factor $\Gamma=250$) agreement is found with the observed total pulsed luminosity. This suggests that the high-energy pulses from young pulsars originate not in the corotating magnetosphere within the light cylinder (as in all other models) but from the radially directed wind well outside it.

1732755,"We present deep L- and M- band imaging with ISAAC on the ESO VLT with unprecedented spatial resolution of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxies NGC 7496 and NGC 7582 and the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 7213.

The overall morphology of the extended component follows the general isophote pattern defined by the near-infrared continuum of the galaxies. However, the central 300 pc regions show much more ordered elliptical isophotes than in the near-infrared. In particular, emission in the L- and M-bands shows well defined central point sources in the two Seyfert 2s. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters"
1732756,"As one of the most luminous radio-loud quasars showing intrinsic ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray absorption, 3C 351 provides a laboratory for studying the kinematics and physical conditions of such ionized absorbers. We present an analysis of the intrinsic absorption lines in the high-resolution ($\sim$ 7 km/s) far-UV spectrum which was obtained from observations with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectrum spans wavelengths from 1150 \AA to 1710 \AA, and shows strong emission lines from O VI and Ly$\alpha$. Associated absorption lines are present on the blue wings of the high-ionization emission doublets O VI $\lambda\lambda$ 1032,1038 and N V $\lambda\lambda$ 1238,1242, as well as the Lyman lines through Ly$\epsilon$. These intrinsic absorption features are resolved into several distinct kinematic components, covering rest-frame velocities from -40 to -2800 km/s, with respect to the systemic redshift of $z_{em}=0.3721$. For the majority of these absorption line regions, strong evidence of partial covering of both the background continuum source and the BELR is found, which supports the intrinsic absorption origin and rules out the possibility that the absorption arises in some associated cluster of galaxies. The relationship between the far-UV absorbers and X-ray `warm' absorbers are studied with the assistance of photoionization models. Most of the UV associated absorption components have low values of the ionization parameter and total hydrogen column densities, which is inconsistent with previous claims that the UV and X-ray absorption arises in the same material. Analysis of these components supports a picture with a wide range of ionization parameters, temperatures, and column densities in AGN outflows. Comment: 27 pages with 5 figures, accepted by ApJ"
1732757,"We present GMRT observations of the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915+105 at 1.28 GHz for 8 days from 2001 June 18 to July 1. We have seen several isolated radio flares of varying magnitudes (20 - 50 mJy) and durations (6 - 35 min) and we model them as due to adiabatically expanding synchrotron emitting clouds (synchrotron bubbles) ejected from the accretion disk. By applying this model, we provide a new method to estimate the electron power-law index p, hence the spectral index, from single frequency radio observations. This method does not require correction for the optical depth time delay effects which may be important in the case of optically thick radio emission. Using our estimated value of p and simultaneous multiwavelength data from literature, we have calculated the time of ejection of the synchrotron plasma and the time delays at different observed frequencies. Our estimates are in good agreement with the observed time delays. Comment: Accepted for publication in A&A Letters"
1732758,"We report on a 20 ks XMM observation of the distant cluster , discovered at $z=0.6$ in the SHARC survey. The cluster has a regular spherical morphology, suggesting it is in a relaxed state. The combined fit of the EPIC/MOS&pn camera gives a cluster mean temperature of $kT= 5.3\pm0.5~\rm keV$ with an iron abundance of $0.47\pm0.19$. The temperature profile, measured for the first time at such a redshift, is consistent with an isothermal atmosphere up to half the virial radius. The surface brightness profile, measured nearly up to the virial radius, is well fitted by a , with $\beta =0.78^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ and a core radius of $\theta_{\rm c} = 0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.04}~{\rm arcmin}$. We compared the properties of  with the properties of nearby clusters for two cosmological models: an Einstein–de Sitter Universe and a flat low density Universe with $\rm \Omega_{0}=0.3$. For both models, the scaled emission measure profile beyond the core, the gas mass fraction and luminosity are consistent with the expectations of the self-similar model of cluster formation, although a slightly better agreement is obtained for a low density Universe. There is no evidence of a central cooling flow, in spite of the apparent relaxed state of the cluster. This is consistent with its estimated cooling time, larger than the age of the Universe at the cluster redshift. The entropy profile shows a flat core with a central entropy of ${\sim} 140~\rm keV~{\rm cm^{2}}$, remarkably similar to the entropy floor observed in nearby clusters, and a rising profile beyond typically $0.1$ virial radius. Implications of our results, in terms of non-gravitational physics in cluster formation, are discussed."
1732759,We present a general description of the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) hypothesis in the cosmological context. The scenario of structure formation under such a hypothesis is based on Jeans instabilities of fluctuations of the scalar field. It is shown that it is possible to form stable long lived objects consisting of a wide range of typical galactic masses around 1012M ⊙ once the parameters of the effective theory are fixed with the cosmological constraints. The energy density at the origin of such an object is smooth as it should.
1732760,"We have developed a high-precision code which solves the kinematic dynamo problem both for given rotation law and meridional flow in the case of a low eddy diffusivity of the order of 1011 cm2 s-1 known from the sunspot decay. All our models work with an alpha -effect which is positive (negative) in the northern (southern) hemisphere. It is concentrated in radial layers located either at the top or at the bottom of the convection zone. We have also considered an alpha -effect uniformly distributed in all the convection zone. In the present paper the main attention is focused on i) the parity of the solution, ii) the form of the butterfly diagram and iii) the phase relation of the resulting field components. If the helioseismologically derived internal solar rotation law is considered, a model without meridional flow of high magnetic Reynolds number (corresponding to low eddy diffusivity) fails in all the three issues in comparison with the observations. However, a meridional flow with equatorial drift at the bottom of the convection zone of few meters by second can indeed enforce the equatorward migration of the toroidal magnetic field belts similar to the observed butterfly diagram but, the solution has only a dipolar parity if the (positive) alpha -effect is located at the base of the convection zone rather than at the top. We can, therefore, confirm the main results of a similar study by Dikpati & Gilman (\cite{Dikpati01})."
1732761,"We have carried out 21 cm radio continuum, H76_\alpha radio recombination line, and various (CO, ^13CO, CS, & C^34S) molecular line observations of the W31 complex. Our radio continuum data show that W31 is composed of two extended HII regions, G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1, each of which comprises an ultracompact HII region, two or more compact components, and diffuse envelope. The W31 cloud appears as an incomplete shell on the whole and consists of southern spherical and northern flat components, which are associated with G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1, respectively. We detect two large and massive CS-emitting regions in the northern and southern cloud components. The large amount of dense gas may suggest that the W31 cloud has ability to form rich stellar clusters and that star formation has only recently begun. The extended envelopes of both G10.2-0.3 and G10.3-0.1 are likely to be results of the champagne flows, based on the distributions of ionized and molecular gas and the velocity gradient of H76_\alpha line emission. We find strong evidence of bipolar molecular outflows associated with the two ultracompact HII regions. In the vicinity of the ultracompact and compact HII regions in G10.3-0.1, the CO J=2-1/J=1-0 intensity ratio is high (1.4) and a small but prominent molecular gas hollow exists. These observations strongly indicate that the HII regions and their ionizing stars are interacting with the molecular cloud. Therefore, it is most likely that recently formed massive stars are actively disrupting their parental molecular cloud in the W31 complex.

1732762,"The generalized maximum entropy method (GMEM) is a special modification of the standard maximum entropy method (MEM) which seeks solutions in the space of complex functions. In this work a reduced version of the GMEM intended for reconstructing real images with positive and negative values is used. As compared with the standard MEM, intended for the reconstruction of only non-negative images, the GMEM allows us to obtain higher-quality images with a much lower level of nonlinear distortions caused by errors in the data. Here, we present the results of the GMEM imaging of 36 selected extragalactic radio sources with a resolution of 0.3-0.5 mas on astrometric and geodetic VLBI observations at 8.2 GHz, obtained with a global array in the period from 1994-1996. In VLBI mapping practice this is the first experience of imaging with such a high resolution using maximum entropy technique. A differential maximum entropy method intended for increasing the dynamic range of images is demonstrated on the radio source 0059+581. In the case of unreliable `closure' phases, completely `phaseless' methods of mapping are recommended. Maps of two sources 0615+820 and 0642+214 are obtained using one such method."
1732763,"We have used the IRAM 30-m and FCRAO 14-m telescopes to observe the molecular clumps associated with 12 ultracompact (UC) HII regions in the J=6-5, 8-7 and 13-12 rotational transitions of methyl-acetylene (CH3C2H). Under the assumption of LTE and optically thin emission, we have derived temperature estimates ranging from 30 to 56 K. We estimate that the clumps have diameters of 0.2-1.6 pc, H_2 densities of 10^5-10^6 {cm^{-3}}, and masses of 10^2-2 10^4 M_\odot. We compare these values with those obtained by other authors from different molecular tracers and find that the H_2 density and the temperature inside the clumps vary respectively like n_{H_2} ~ R^{-2.6} and T ~ R^{-0.5}, with R distance from the centre. We also find that the virial masses of the clumps are ~3 times less than those derived from the CH3C2H column densities: we show that a plausible explanation is that magnetic fields play an important role to stabilise the clumps, which are on the verge of gravitational collapse. Finally, we show that the CH3C2H line width increases for decreasing distance from the clump centre: this effect is consistent with infall in the inner regions of the clumps. We conclude that the clumps around UC HII regions are likely to be transient (~10^(5) yr) entities, remnants of isothermal spheres currently undergoing gravitational collapse: the high mass accretion rates (~10^{-2} M_\odot yr^{-1}) lead to massive star formation at the centre of such clumps.

1732764,"Well into the deleptonization phase of a core collapse supernova, a first-order phase transition to matter with macroscopic strangeness content is assumed to occur and lead to a structured lattice defined by negatively charged strange droplets. The lattice is shown to crystallize for expected droplet charges and separations at temperatures typically obtained during the protoneutronstar evolution. The melting curve of the lattice for small spherical droplets is presented. The one-component plasma model proves to be an adequate description for the lattice in its solid phase with deformation modes freezing out around the melting temperature. The mechanical stability against shear stresses is such that velocities predicted for convective phenomena and differential rotation during the Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling phase might prevent the crystallization of the phase transition lattice. A solid lattice might be fractured by transient convection, which could result in anisotropic neutrino transport. The melting curve of the lattice is relevant for the mechanical evolution of the protoneutronstar and therefore should be included in future hydrodynamics simulations.

1732765,"Observations in the Hubble Deep Fields have been used to study the evolution of galaxy morphology over time. The majority of galaxies with z < 1 are seen to be disk like, whereas most objects with z > 2 appear to be either chaotic or centrally concentrated ``blobs''. Such blobs might be the ancestral objects of ellipticals or of galaxy bulges. About 1/3 of objects with z > 2 appear to be in the process of merging. The region with 1 < z < 2 marks an important transition in the global history of star formation from a merger dominated regime at z > 2, to one at z < 1 in which most star formation takes place in galactic disks. It is speculated that the break in the Madau plot at z sim 1.5 might be related to the transition from merger-dominated star formation at z > 2 to disk-dominated star formation at at z < 1.

1732766,"This paper investigates the origin of the observed large variety in dust-to-gas ratio among blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs). By applying our chemical evolution model, we find that the dust destruction can largely suppress the dust-to-gas ratio when the metallicity of a BCD reaches $12+\log{\rm (O/H)}\sim 8$, i.e., a typical metallicity level of BCDs. We also show that dust-to-gas ratio is largely varied owing to the change of dust destruction efficiency that has two effects: (i) a significant contribution of Type Ia supernovae to total supernova rate; (ii) variation of gas mass contained in a star-forming region. While mass loss from BCDs was previously thought to be the major cause for the variance of dust-to-gas ratio, we suggest that the other two effects are also important. We finally discuss the intermittent star formation history, which naturally explains the large dispersion of dust-to-gas ratio among BCDs. Comment: 7 pages LaTeX, to appear in A&A"
1732767,"We have observed the polarized light at 2 μm in the center of NGC 1068 with NICMOS Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope. The nucleus is dominated by a bright, unresolved source, polarized at a level of 6.0% ± 1.2% with a position angle of 122° ± 15°. There are two polarized lobes extending up to 8'' northeast and southwest of the nucleus. The polarized flux in both lobes is quite clumpy, with the maximum polarization occurring in the southwest lobe at a level of 17% when smoothed to 023 resolution. The perpendiculars to the polarization vectors in these two lobes point back to the intense unresolved nuclear source to within one 0076 Camera 2 pixel, thereby confirming that this is the illuminating source of the scattered light and therefore the probable active galactic nucleus central engine. Whereas the polarization of the nucleus is probably caused by dichroic absorption, the polarization in the lobes is almost certainly caused by scattering, with very little contribution from dichroic absorption. Features in the polarized lobes include a gap at a distance of about 1'' from the nucleus toward the southwest lobe and a ""knot"" of emission about 5'' northeast of the nucleus. Both features had been discussed by ground-based observers, but they are much better defined with the high spatial resolution of NICMOS. The northeast knot may be the side of a molecular cloud that is facing the nucleus, which may be preventing the expansion of the northeast radio lobe at the head of the radio synchrotron-radiation-emitting jet. We also report the presence of two ghosts in the Camera 2 polarizers. These had not been detected previously (Hines et al.) because they are relatively faint and require observations of a source with a large dynamic range."
1732768,"We present mid-IR photometric properties for a sample of 28 early-type galaxies observed at 6.75, 9.63 and 15 um with the ISOCAM instrument on board the ISO satellite. We find total mid-IR luminosities in the range 3-48x10^8 L_sun. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the galaxies were derived using the mid-IR data together with previously published UV, optical and near-IR data. These SEDs clearly show a mid-IR emission coming from dust heated at T ~ 260 K. Dust grains properties are inferred from the mid-IR colors. The masses of the hot dust component are in the range 10-400 M_sun. The relationship between the masses derived from mid-IR observations and those derived from visual extinction are discussed. The possible common heating source for the gas and dust is investigated through the correlations between Ha and mid-IR luminosities.

1732769,"We compute the luminosity of K_alpha emission lines produced by astrophysically abundant elements in the soft X-ray spectra of the early afterglow of gamma-ray bursts. We find that the detection of these lines can be a diagnostic for the geometrical set-up of the reprocessing material. In particular we can distinguish between a ``geometry dominated'' model, in which the line emission is coming from an extended region and its duration arises from light-travel-time effects and an ``engine dominated'' model, where the line emitting gas is in a smaller region, irradiated for a longer period. These lines therefore offer clues to the dynamics and time-scale of the explosion leading to a gamma-ray burst.

1732770,"We analyze the frequency evolution of millisecond oscillations observed during type I X-ray bursts with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in order to establish the stability of the mechanism underlying the oscillations. Our sample contains 68 pulse trains detected in a search of 159 bursts from 8 accreting neutron stars. As a first step, we confirm that the oscillations usually drift upward in frequency by about 1% toward an apparent saturation frequency. Previously noted anomalies, such as drifts toward lower frequencies as the oscillations disappear (``spin-down'' episodes) and instances of two signals present simultaneously at frequencies separated by a few Hz, occur in 5% of oscillations. Having verified the generally accepted description of burst oscillations, we proceed to study the coherence of the oscillations during individual bursts, and the dispersion in the asymptotic frequencies in bursts observed over five years. On short time scales, we find that 30% of the oscillation trains do not appear to evolve smoothly in phase. This suggests either that two signals are present simultaneously with a frequency difference too small to resolve (< 1 Hz), that the frequency evolution is discontinuous, or that discrete phase jumps occur. On time scales of years, the maximum frequencies of the oscillations exhibit fractional dispersions of < 0.004. In the case of 4U 1636-536, this dispersion is uncorrelated with the known orbital phase, which indicates that a mechanism besides orbital Doppler shifts prevents the oscillations from appearing perfectly stable. We interpret these results under the assumption that the oscillations originate from anisotropies in the emission from the surfaces of these rotating neutron stars.

1732771,"We present the results of Chandra observations of off-nuclear X-ray sources in the spiral galaxy M51 (NGC 5194). 113 X-ray sources have been detected in the field of view and 84 among them project within the disk of NGC 5194. Six and twenty eight sources have luminosities exceeding 1x10^39 ergs s^-1 and 1x10^38 ergs s^-1 in the 0.5-8 keV band, respectively. The number of luminous sources is much higher than normal spiral and elliptical galaxies and similar to galaxies experiencing starburst activity. X-ray spectra of most of the detected sources are consistent with a power law with a photon index between 1 and 2, while one source has an extremely hard spectrum and two sources have soft spectra. The spectra of three ultraluminous sources are consistent with both a power law and a multicolor disk blackbody (MCD) model, while a power law model is preferable to a MCD model in two objects. One luminous object which shows a remarkable spectrum, including emission lines, is also found and discussed."
1732772,"Numerical simulations of 15 orbits of an equal-mass binary black hole system are presented. Gravitational waveforms from these simulations, covering more than 30 cycles and ending about 1.5 cycles before merger, are compared with those from quasi-circular zero-spin post-Newtonian (PN) formulae. The cumulative phase uncertainty of these comparisons is about 0.05 radians, dominated by effects arising from the small residual spins of the black holes and the small residual orbital eccentricity in the simulations. Matching numerical results to PN waveforms early in the run yields excellent agreement (within 0.05 radians) over the first $\sim 15$ cycles, thus validating the numerical simulation and establishing a regime where PN theory is accurate. In the last 15 cycles to merger, however, {\em generic} time-domain Taylor approximants build up phase differences of several radians. But, apparently by coincidence, one specific post-Newtonian approximant, TaylorT4 at 3.5PN order, agrees much better with the numerical simulations, with accumulated phase differences of less than 0.05 radians over the 30-cycle waveform. Gravitational-wave amplitude comparisons are also done between numerical simulations and post-Newtonian, and the agreement depends on the post-Newtonian order of the amplitude expansion: the amplitude difference is about 6--7% for zeroth order and becomes smaller for increasing order. A newly derived 3.0PN amplitude correction improves agreement significantly ($<1%$ amplitude difference throughout most of the run, increasing to 4% near merger) over the previously known 2.5PN amplitude terms.

1732773,"We use galaxies detected in a deep ultraviolet XMM-Newton Optical Monitor image and a model that predicts UV galaxy counts based on local counts and evolution parameters to constrain galaxy evolution to Z=1.2. The 17' square 2000 angstrom (UVW2 filter) image was taken as part of the XMM-OM team's guaranteed time program. We detect sources in this image to a flux limit of 2.7 X 10^{-17} ergs/cm^2/s/A, (AB magnitude = 22). Since some of the sources may be stars, we perform a number of checks, including shape, color and implied distance to remove stars from the detected counts. We find galaxy number counts as a function of magnitude roughly in agreement with previous studies, but again find these counts are in excess of evolution models. The excess counts at faint magnitudes may provide evidence for either a new population of galaxies emerging around Z=0.7 or more dramatic evolution than some earlier predictions. The integrated light from the detected galaxies totals 32--36 ph/cm^2/s/A/sr, placing a firm lower limit on the integrated UV light from galaxies."
1732774,"The Canadian Large Adaptive Reflector (CLAR) is a proposed prototype of a new concept for large, filled-aperture radio telescopes. The prototype would have a 300-metre aperture, working up to frequencies of at least 1.4 GHz, and would be equipped with a multi-beam phased array providing a field-of-view of 0.8deg at that frequency. The largest fully-steerable radio telescope in the world, and endowed with a large field-of-view, the CLAR will be uniquely suited for deep spectral imaging over large areas of the sky. Conducted over a period of three to four years, a CLAR Northern-Sky Survey would allow us to simultaneously: survey at arcminute scales the distribution and kinematics of the faint HI in the halo of the Milky Way and High Velocity Clouds; chart the large scale distribution of galaxies in HI out to redshift close to 1; reveal the structure and dynamics of the cosmic web responsible for wide-spread Lyman $\alpha$ absorption systems; image the signal of the reionization of the Universe over a large area with resolution of 10's of arcminutes."
1732775,"Evidence is presented for the recent evolution of the relaxation processes in clusters of galaxies, using large optical and X-ray cluster samples. The criteria of the cluster relaxation used are the cluster ellipticity, the intracluster medium (ICM) temperature, and X-ray cluster luminosity. We find evidence of varying strength and significance of all three indicators evolving with redshift for z 0.15. This result supports the view that clusters have mostly stopped undergoing mergers and accreting matter, as expected in a low-Ωm universe, and are now in the process of gravitational relaxation, which reduces their flattening, their ICM temperature (shock heated during the merging phase), and their X-ray luminosity. These results support similar recent claims of Melott, Chambers, & Miller."
1732776,"We compute primordial light-element abundances for cases with fine structure constant alpha different from the present value, including many sources of alpha dependence neglected in previous calculations. Specifically, we consider contributions arising from Coulomb barrier penetration, photon coupling to nuclear currents, and the electromagnetic components of nuclear masses. We find the primordial abundances to depend more weakly on alpha than previously estimated, by up to a factor of 2 in the case of ^7Li. We discuss the constraints on variations in alpha from the individual abundance measurements and the uncertainties affecting these constraints. While the present best measurements of primordial D/H, ^4He/H, and ^7Li/H may be reconciled pairwise by adjusting alpha and the universal baryon density, no value of alpha allows all three to be accommodated simultaneously without consideration of systematic error. The combination of measured abundances with observations of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background favors no change in alpha within the uncertainties."
1732777,"Challenging stellar dynamical problems, such as the study of gravothermal oscillations in star clusters, have in the past initiated the very successful building of GRAPE special purpose computers. It is discussed, that present day tasks such as the formation and evolution of galactic nuclei with one or more massive black holes and the coupled stellar and gas dynamical processes in the formation of nuclei and star clusters, demand a new kind of hybrid architecture, using both GRAPE and a reconfigurable logics board called RACE. For such a system we have developed first implementations and floating point performance studies in the case of the SPH algorithm (smoothed particle hydrodynamics), which will be of great advantage for SPH modelling and also for direct $N$-body simulations using the more efficient Ahmad-Cohen neighbour schemes."
1732778,"We discuss the structure of parametric resonance which occurs in the process of reheating after inflation with two interacting scalar fields. It is found that, for the case of a not too large coupling constant, a quasi-homogeneous part of the second, initially subdominant scalar field may not be neglected due to its stochastic growth during inflation. This fact has strong consequences for the reheating stage: dynamics of background fields becomes chaotic after inflation -- it consists of subsequent chaotic and regular eras, and a tachyonic instability for inhomogeneous perturbations arises in the quantum reheating problem. This instability may pose a problem for the standard reheating scenario. In order to avoid it, the coupling constant should be either sufficiently small, or very large."
1732779,"New estimates of the distances of 36 nearby galaxies is presented. These are based on the calibration of the $V$- and $I$-band Period-Luminosity relations for galactic Cepheids measured by the HIPPARCOS mission. The distance moduli are obtained in a classical way. The statistical bias due to the incompleteness of the sample is corrected according to the precepts introduced by Teerikorpi ([CITE]). We adopt a constant slope (the one obtained with LMC Cepheids). The correction for incompleteness bias introduces an uncertainty that depends on each galaxy. On average, this uncertainty is small (0.04 mag) but it may reach 0.3 mag. We show that the uncertainty due to the correction of the extinction is small (propably less than 0.05 mag). The correlation between the metallicity and the morphological type of the host galaxy suggests that we should reduce the application to spiral galaxies in order to bypass the problem of metallicity. We suspect that the adopted PL slopes are not valid for all morphological types of galaxies. This may induce a mean systematic shift of 0.1 mag on distance moduli. A comparison with the distance moduli recently published by Freedman et al. ([CITE]) shows there is a reasonably good agreement with our distance moduli."
1732780,"We define and characterize a photometric bandpass (called ``Y'') that is centered near 1.035 μm, in between the traditionally classified ``optical'' and ``infrared'' spectral regimes. We present Y magnitudes and Y-H and Y-K colors for a sample consisting mostly of photometric and spectral standards, spanning the spectral type range sdO to T5 V. Deep molecular absorption features in the near-infrared spectra of extremely cool objects are such that the Y-H and Y-K colors grow rapidly with advancing spectral type especially from late M through mid-L, substantially more rapidly than J-H or H-K, which span a smaller total dynamic range. Consistent with other near-infrared colors, however, Y-H and Y-K colors turn blueward in the L6-L8 temperature range, with later T-type objects having colors similar to those of warmer M and L stars. Y-J colors remain constant at 1.0+/-0.15 mag from early-L through late-T dwarfs. The slope of the interstellar reddening vector within this filter is AY=0.38AV. Reddening moves stars nearly along the YHK dwarf color sequence, making it more difficult to distinguish unambiguously very low mass candidate brown dwarf objects from higher mass stars seen, e.g., through the Galactic plane or toward star-forming regions. Other diagrams involving the Y band may be somewhat more discriminating."
1732781,"We present 2-45 micron spectra of a large sample of carbon-rich evolved stars in order to study the ``30'' micron feature. We find the ``30'' micron feature in sources in a wide range of sources: low mass loss carbon stars, extreme carbon-stars, post-AGB objects and planetary nebulae. We extract the profiles from the sources by using a simple systematic approach to model the continuum. We find large variations in the wavelength and width of the extracted profiles of the ``30'' micron feature. We modelled the whole range of profiles in a simple way by using magnesium sulfide (MgS) dust grains with a MgS grain temperature different from the continuum temperature. The systematic change in peak positions can be explained by cooling of MgS grains as the star evolves off the AGB. In several sources we find that a residual emission excess at ~26 micron can also be fitted using MgS grains but with a different grains shape distribution. The profiles of the ``30'' micron feature in planetary nebulae are narrower than our simple MgS model predicts. We discuss the possible reasons for this difference. We find a sample of warm carbon-stars with very cold MgS grains. We discuss possible causes for this phenomenon. We find no evidence for rapid destruction of MgS during the planetary nebula phase and conclude that the MgS may survive to be incorporated in the ISM.

1732782,"We present long-slit spectra of three irregular galaxies from which we determine the stellar kinematics in two of the galaxies (NGC 1156 and NGC 4449) and ionized gas kinematics in all three (including NGC 2366). We compare this to the optical morphology and H I kinematics of the galaxies. In the ionized gas, we see a linear velocity gradient in all three galaxies. In NGC 1156 we also detect a weak linear velocity gradient in the stars of (5 ± 1/ sin i) km s-1 kpc-1 to a radius of 1.6 kpc. The stars and gas are rotating about the same axis, but this is different from the major axis of the stellar bar, which dominates the optical light of the galaxy. In NGC 4449 we do not detect organized rotation of the stars and place an upper limit of km s-1 kpc-1 to a radius of 1.2 kpc. For NGC 4449, which has signs of a past interaction with another galaxy, we develop a model to fit the observed kinematics of the stars and gas. In this model the stellar component is in a rotating disk seen nearly face-on, while the gas is in a tilted disk with orbits whose planes precess in the gravitational potential. This model reproduces the apparent counterrotation of the inner gas of the galaxy. The peculiar orbits of the gas are presumed as a result of acquisition of gas in the past interaction."
1732783,"We show that the inclusion of special relativistic corrections in the revised OPAL and MHD equations of state has a significant impact on the helioseismic determination of the solar age. Models with relativistic corrections included lead to a reduction of about $0.05 - 0.08 \gi $ with respect to those obtained with the old OPAL or MHD EOS. Our best-fit value is $t_\mathrm{seis} = (4.57 \pm 0.11) \gi $ which is in remarkably good agreement with the meteoritic value for the solar age. We argue that the inclusion of relativistic corrections is important for probing the evolutionary state of a star by means of the small frequency separations $\delta\nu_{{\ell,n}}=\nu_{{\ell,n}}-\nu_{{\ell+2,n-1}}$, for spherical harmonic degrees $\ell = 0,1$ and radial order $n \gg \ell$."
1732784,"We make use of high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra of 12 turn-off stars in the metal-poor globular cluster NGC 6397 to measure its lithium content. We conclude that they all have the same lithium abundance A(Li) = 2.34 with a standard deviation of 0.056 dex. We use this result, together with Monte Carlo simulations, to estimate that the maximum allowed intrinsic scatter is of the order of 0.035 dex. This is a new stringent constraint to be fulfilled by stellar models which predict Li depletion. We argue that although a mild depletion of 0.1 -- 0.2 dex, as predicted by recent models, cannot be ruled out, there is no compelling reason for it. This fact, together with the good agreement with the Li abundance observed in field stars, supports the primordial origin of lithium in metal-poor stars. Taking the above value as the primordial lithium abundance implies a cosmic baryonic density which is either Omega_b h^2 = 0.016 +/- 0.004 or Omega_b h^2 = 0.005 ^{+0.0026}_{-0.0006}, from the predictions of standard big bang nucleosynthesis. The high baryonic density solution is in agreement with recent results on the primordial abundance of deuterium and 3He and on the estimates derived from the fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background.

1732785,"BeppoSAX is best known for its role in the disclosure of the Gamma-Ray Burst mystery, but it has also improved our understanding of jetted sources in general, and blazars in particular. On the interpretational side, we are curious to see if all sources with relativistic jets (or ""flying pancakes"", as in GRBs) are controlled by the same basic physics, despite the very different lifetimes and behavior. To this end we explore some general characteristics of blazars, GRBs and superluminal galactic sources, such as their bulk Lorentz factors, the power of their jets compared with what they can extract through accretion, and the value of the magnetic field, close to the black hole, needed to extract the spin energy of a rotating black hole. We find remarkable similarities, namely that the outflowing mass rate is of the order of 1 per cent of the accretion mass rate in all systems, and that the value of the magnetic field required to efficiently extract the spin energy of the black hole is of the order of the gravitational energy density of the matter close to the gravitational radius. We then go on to discuss the way in which the energy in bulk relativistic motion can be transformed into beamed radiation, and consider the possibility that all three classes of sources could work in the same way, namely by a intermittent release of relativistic plasma at the base of the jet and thus with similar efficiency. Different patches of material, with slightly different velocities, collide at some distance from the black hole, producing the radiation we see."
1732786,"We calculate and provide analytic fits of the factors which describe the reduction of the neutrino emissivity of modified Urca and nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung processes by superfluidity of neutrons and protons in neutron-star cores. We consider $^1$S$_0$ pairing of protons and either $^1$S$_0$ or $^3$P$_2$ pairing of neutrons. We analyze two types of $^3$P$_2$ pairing: the familiar pairing with zero projection of the total angular momentum of neutron pairs onto quantization axis, $m_J=0$; and the pairing with $|m_J|=2$ which leads to the gap with nodes at the neutron Fermi surface. Combining the new data with those available in the literature we fully describe neutrino emission by nucleons from neutron star cores to be used in simulations of cooling of superfluid neutron stars."
1732787,"We say that a Cellular Automata (CA) is coalescing when its execution on two distinct (random) initial configurations in the same asynchronous mode (the same cells are updated in each configuration at each time step) makes both configurations become identical after a reasonable time. We prove coalescence for two elementary rules, non coalescence for two other, and show that there exists infinitely many coalescing CA. We then conduct an experimental study on all elementary CA and show that some rules exhibit a phase transition, which belongs to the universality class of directed percolation."
1732788,"Detailed neutral hydrogen observations have been obtained of the large barred spiral galaxy NGC 3992 and its three small companion galaxies, UGC 6923, UGC 6940, and UGC 6969. For the main galaxy, the HI distribution is regular with a low level radial extension outside the stellar disc. However, at exactly the region of the bar, there is a pronounced central HI hole in the gas distribution. Likely gas has been transported inwards by the bar and because of the emptyness of the hole no large accretion events can have happened in recent galactic times. The gas kinematics is very regular and it is demonstrated that the influence of the bar potential on the velocity field is negligible. A precise and extended rotation curve has been derived showing some distinct features which can be explained by the non-exponential radial light distribution of NGC 3992. The decomposition of the rotation curve gives a slight preference for a sub maximal disc, though a range of disc contributions, up to a maximum disc situation fits nearly equally well. For such a maximum disc contribution, which might be expected in order to generate and maintain the bar, the required mass-to-light ratio is large but not exceptional.

1732789,"We present 0.95--2.5 micron moderate (R = 500) resolution spectra of 19 ISOCAM detected sources in the Chamaeleon I dark cloud. Thirteen of these stars are candidate very low mass members of the cloud proposed by Persi et al. (2000 A&A 357:219) on basis of the mid-IR color excess. The sample also includes a bona-fide young brown dwarf (Cha Halpha 1), a transition --stellar/sub-stellar-- object (Cha Halpha 2), one previously known T Tauri star (Sz 33) and three ISOCAM sources with no mid-IR excess. The spectra of the mid-IR color excess sources are relatively flat and featureless in this wavelength range. Both atomic and molecular lines (when in absorption) are partially veiled suggesting the presence of continuum emission from circumstellar dust. In addition some of the sources show Paschen and Brackett lines in emission. We apply the 2 micron water vapor index defined by Wilking et al. (1999 AJ 117:469) to estimate spectral types. These stars have spectral types M0--8. We use Persi et al.'s stellar luminosity determinations, in combination with D'Antona & Mazzitelli latest pre-main sequence evolutionary tracks, to estimate masses and ages. The ISOCAM detected mid-IR excess sources have sub-solar masses down to the H-burning limit and a median age of few x 10^6 yr, in good agreement with the higher mass members of this cloud.

1732790,"We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the X-ray transient XTE J1859+226, obtained during outburst and its subsequent decay to quiescence. Both the X-ray and optical properties are very similar to those of well-studied black hole soft X-ray transients. We have detected three mini-outbursts, when XTE J1859+226 was approaching quiescence, as has been previously detected in the soft X-ray transients GRO J0422+32 and GRS 1009–45. By 2000 August 24 the system had reached quiescence with R= 22.48 ± 0.07. The estimated distance to the source is ∼11 kpc. Photometry taken during quiescence shows a sinusoidal modulation with a peak to peak amplitude of about 0.4 mag. A period analysis suggests that periods from 0.28 to 0.47 d are equally possible at the 68 per cent confidence level. The amplitude of the quiescent light curve and the relatively low ratio of X-ray to optical flux indicate that the binary inclination should be high. The measured colours during the outburst allow us to obtain the basic properties of the disc, which agrees well with irradiated disc model predictions."
1732791,"The study of the robust features of the magnetosphere is motivated both by new ""whole system"" approaches, and by the idea of ""space climate"" as opposed to ""space weather"". We enumerate these features for the AE index, and discuss whether self-organised criticality (SOC) is the most natural explanation of the ""stylised facts"" so far known for AE. We identify and discuss some open questions, answers to which will clarify the extent to which AE's properties provide evidence for SOC. We then suggest an SOC-like reconnection-based scenario drawing on the result of Craig(2001) as an explanation of the very recent demonstration by Uritsky et al(2001b) of power laws in several properties of spatiotemporal features seen in auroral images."
1732792,We study the merging of star clusters out of cluster aggregates similar to Knot S in the Antennae on orbits close to the one of ω Cen by carrying out high resolution numerical N-body simulations.

1732793,"We report medium-resolution (1-2 A) spectroscopy and broadband (UBV) photometry for a sample of 39 bright stars (the majority of which are likely to be giants) selected as metal-deficient candidates from an objective-prism survey concentrating on Galactic latitudes below |b| = 30 deg, the LSE survey of Drilling & Bergeron. Although the primary purpose of the LSE survey was to select OB stars (hence the concentration on low latitudes), the small number of bright metal-deficient giant candidates noted during this survey provide interesting information on the metal-weak thick disk (MWTD) population. The kinematics of the LSE giants indicate the presence of a rapidly rotating population, even at quite low metallicity. We consider the distribution of orbital eccentricity of the LSE giants as a function of [Fe/H], and conclude that the local fraction (i.e., within 1 kpc from the Sun) of metal-poor stars that might be associated with the MWTD is on the order of 30%-40% at abundances below [Fe/H] = -1.0. Contrary to recent analyses of previous (much larger) samples of non-kinematically selected metal-poor stars, we find that this relatively high fraction of local metal-poor stars associated with the MWTD may extend to metallicities below [Fe/H] = -1.6, much lower than had been considered before. We identify a subsample of 11 LSE stars that are very likely to be members of the MWTD, based on their derived kinematics; the lowest metallicity among these stars is [Fe/H] = -2.35. Implications of these results for the origin of the MWTD and for the formation of the Galaxy are considered.

1732794,"We consider a differential method of maximum entropy that is based on the linearity of Fourier transform and involves reconstruction of images from the differences of the visibility function. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with respect to the recovery of source images with bright components against the background of a sufficiently weak extended base. The simulation results are given along with the maps of an extragalactic radio source 0059+581, which were obtained using the standard and differential methods of maximum entropy for three observation dates and show that the principle of differential mapping allows us to increase considerably the dynamic interval of images."

1732796,"I report the results of a survey for low-mass (0.030 M☉ M 0.013 M☉) brown dwarfs in the direction of the TW Hya association using the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Two late M dwarfs show signs of low surface gravity and are strong candidates to be young, very low mass (M ≈ 0.025 M☉) brown dwarfs related to the TW Hya association. The object 2MASSW J1207334-393254 is particularly notable for its strong Hα emission. The number of detected brown dwarfs is consistent with the substellar mass function in richer star formation environments. Newly identified late M and L dwarfs in the field are also discussed. Unusual objects include an L dwarf with strong Hα emission, a possible wide M8-M9 triple system, and a possible L dwarf companion to an LHS star."
1732797,"We present results from a detailed spectrophotometric analysis of the blue compact dwarf galaxy (BCD) Mrk 370, based on deep UBVRI broadband and Hα narrowband observations, and on long-slit and two-dimensional spectroscopy of its brightest knots. The spectroscopic data are used to derive the internal extinction and to compute metallicities, electronic density, and temperature in the knots. By subtracting the contribution of the underlying older stellar population, modeled by an exponential function, removing the contribution from emission lines, and correcting for extinction, we can measure the true colors of the young star-forming knots. We show that the colors obtained this way differ significantly from those derived without the above corrections and lead to different estimates of the ages and star-forming history of the knots. Using predictions of evolutionary synthesis models, we estimate the ages of both the starburst regions and the underlying stellar component. We found that we can reproduce the colors of all the knots with an instantaneous burst of star formation and the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) with an upper mass limit of 100 M☉. The resulting ages range between 3 and 6 Myr. The colors of the low surface brightness component are consistent with ages larger than 5 Gyr. The kinematic results suggest ordered motion around the major axis of the galaxy."
1732798,"Detailed neutral hydrogen observations have been obtained of the large barred spiral galaxy NGC 3992 and its three small companion spiral galaxies, UGC 6923, UGC 6940, and UGC 6969. Contrary to the large galaxy, for the companions the HI distribution ends quite abruptly at the optical edges. Velocity fields have been constructed from which rotation curves have been derived. Assuming a reasonable M/L ratio, a decomposition of these rotation curves generates nearly equal dark matter halos. When comparing the position-velocity diagrams of the two brightest galaxies, UGC 6923 and UGC 6969, it is obvious that the rotation curve of the latter has a shape closer to solid body than the former, yet the same maximum rotational level is reached. This is likely generated by the equal dark matter halos in combination with UGC 6923 being a factor five more luminous than UGC 6969 and so its luminous matter gives a higher contribution to the rotation in the inner regions. An NFW-CDMLambda dark halo is consistent with the observed rotation curve of UGC 6923 but not consistent with the rotation curve of UGC 6969. If the NGC 3992 group is part of the Ursa Major cluster, then the I-band M/L ratio of NGC 3992 has to be at least 1.35 times as large as that of the average spiral galaxy in the cluster. On the other hand, equal M/L ratios can be achieved when the NGC 3992 group is placed more than 3 Mpc behind the cluster. Both possibilities can explain why NGC 3992 appears to be 0.43 magnitudes too faint for its rotation.

1732799,"Evidence for excess extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission over a tail of X-ray gas bremsstrahlung emission has been building up recently, but in some cases remains controversial, mostly due to the moderate quality of the EUV data. In order to improve the signal to noise ratio in the EUV, we have performed the wavelet analysis and image reconstructions for five clusters of galaxies observed both at EUV and X-ray energies with the EUVE and ROSAT satellites respectively. The profiles of the EUV and X-ray reconstructed images all differ at a very large confidence level and an EUV excess over a thermal bremsstrahlung tail is detected in all five clusters (Abell 1795, Abell 2199, Abell 4059, Coma and Virgo) up to large radii. These results, coupled with recent XMM-Newton observations, suggest that the EUV excess is probably non thermal in origin.

The same applies to the oxygen isotope shifts if one recalls the known manifestations of the kinetic effects of isotopic fractionation."
1732801,"The heating of the lower solar corona is examined using numerical simulations and theoretical models of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in open magnetic regions. A turbulent energy cascade to small length scales perpendicular to the mean magnetic field can be sustained by driving with low-frequency Alfven waves reflected from mean density and magnetic field gradients. This mechanism deposits energy efficiently in the lower corona, and we show that the spatial distribution of the heating is determined by the mean density through the Alfven speed profile. This provides a robust heating mechanism that can explain observed high coronal temperatures and accounts for the significant heating (per unit volume) distribution below two solar radius needed in models of the origin of the solar wind. The obtained heating per unit mass on the other hand is much more extended indicating that the heating on a per particle basis persists throughout all the lower coronal region considered here.

1732802,"We present deep, high angular resolution, near-infrared images of the obscured Galactic giant H II region NGC 3576. Our images reach objects to ~3 M. We collected high signal-to-noise K-band spectra of eight of the brightest objects, some of which are affected by excess emission and some of which follow a normal interstellar reddening law. None of them displayed photospheric features typical of massive OB-type stars. This indicates that they are still enshrouded in their natal cocoons. The K-band brightest source (NGC 3576 No. 48) shows CO 2.3 μm band head emission, and three others have the same CO feature in absorption. Three sources display spatially unresolved H2 emission, suggesting dense shocked regions close to the stars. We conclude that the remarkable object NGC 3576 No. 48 is an early B/late O star surrounded by a thick circumstellar disk/envelope. A number of other relatively bright cluster members also display excess emission in the K-band, indicative of reprocessing disks around massive stars (YSOs). Such emission appears to be common in other Galactic giant H II regions we have surveyed. The initial mass function slope of the cluster, Γ = -1.62, is consistent with Salpeter's distribution and similar to what has been observed in the Magellanic Cloud clusters and in the periphery of our Galaxy."
1732803,"In this paper, we present an assortment of both standard and advanced Fourier techniques that are useful in the analysis of astrophysical time series of very long duration -- where the observation time is much greater than the time resolution of the individual data points. We begin by reviewing the operational characteristics of Fourier transforms (FTs) of time series data, including power spectral statistics, discussing some of the differences between analyses of binned data, sampled data, and event data, and briefly discuss algorithms for calculating discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of very long time series. We then discuss the response of DFTs to periodic signals, and present techniques to recover Fourier amplitude ""lost"" during simple traditional analyses if the periodicities change frequency during the observation. These techniques include Fourier interpolation which allows us to correct the response for signals that occur between Fourier frequency bins. We then present techniques for estimating additional signal properties such as the signal's centroid and duration in time, the first and second derivatives of the frequency, the pulsed fraction, and an overall estimate of the significance of a detection. Finally, we present a recipe for a basic but thorough Fourier analysis of a time series for well-behaved pulsations. Comment: 38 pages. Submitted to The Astronomical Journal"
1732804,"We discuss how gamma-ray burst (GRB) optical afterglows and multiwavelength observations of their host galaxies can be used to obtain information about the relative amounts of star formation happening in optical and submillimetre galaxies. That such an analysis will be possible follows from the currently-favoured idea that GRBs are closely linked with high-mass star formation. Studying GRB host galaxies offers a method of finding low-luminosity submillimetre galaxies, which cannot be identified either in optical Lyman break surveys, because so much of their star formation is hidden by dust, or in submillimetre surveys, because their submillimetre fluxes are close to or below the confusion limit. Much of the star formation in the Universe could have occurred in such objects, so searching for them is an important exercise. From current observations, GRB host galaxies appear to be neither optically-luminous Class-2 SCUBA galaxies like SMM J02399$-$0136 or SMM J14011+0252, nor galaxies containing dense molecular cores like local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIGs), but rather some intermediate kind of galaxy.

1732805,"AM Her variables – synchronized magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs) – exhibit a different period distribution from other CVs across the period gap. We show that non-AM Her systems may infiltrate the longer-period end of the period gap if they are metal-deficient, but that the position and width of the gap in orbital period are otherwise insensitive to other binary parameters (except for the normalization of the braking rate). In AM Her binaries, magnetic braking is reduced as the wind from the secondary star may be trapped within the magnetosphere of the white dwarf primary. This reduced braking fills the period gap from its short-period end as the dipole magnetic moment of the white dwarf increases. The consistency of these models with the observed distribution of CVs, of both AM Her and non-AM Her type, provides compelling evidence supporting magnetic braking as the agent of angular momentum loss among long-period CVs, and its disruption as the explanation of the 2–3 h period gap among non-magnetic CVs."

1732807,"We present a new type of electromagnetic planar metamaterial that exhibit strong dispersion at a local minimum of losses and is believed to be the first metamaterial analog of electromagnetically induced transparency. We demonstrate that pulses propagating through such metamaterials experience considerable delay, whereas the thickness of the structure along the direction of wave propagation is much smaller than the wavelength, which allows successive stacking of multiple metamaterial slabs. This leads to a significant increase in the band of normal dispersion, as well as in transmission levels. Changes in the velocity of light propagating through dispersive media have been the subject of extensive investigations in the past [1]. In fact, it was predicted [2] and later observed [3, 4] that light pulses can propagate with apparent velocities greater or smaller than in vacuum without strong distortion of shape and width due to pulse reshaping phenomena. Today, control over these effects is essential for the development of optical communication technologies leading to a number of different"
1732808,"IW And was discovered as a unique blue variable, which spends 72% of time in ""inactive"" state, and was only occasionally observed in bright or faint states. Although the past spectroscopy confirmed that the object is a cataclysmic variable (CV), the object has been regarded as significantly different from the known subclasses of CVs. We observed IW And on 55 nights between 2001 December 6 and 2002 March 25. These observations clearly indicate that the object is a Z Cam-type dwarf nova. The duty cycle of standstill in IW And is exceptionally high among Z Cam stars. IW And is apparently the first object to fill the gap between classical Z Cam stars and novalike (NL) stars."
1732809,"We detected the second historical outburst of the 1920 nova IM Nor. Accurate astrometry of the outbursting object revealed the true quiescent counterpart having a magnitude of R=17.0 mag and B=18.0 mag. We show that the quiescent counterpart shows a noticeable variation. From the comparison of light curves and spectroscopic signatures, we propose that IM Nor and CI Aql comprise a new class of recurrent novae bearing some characteristics similar to those of classical novae. We interpret that the noticeable quiescent variation can be a result of either high orbital inclination, which may be also responsible for the low quiescent brightness, or the presence of high/low states. If the second possibility is confirmed by future observations, IM Nor becomes the first recurrent nova showing state changes in quiescence. Such state changes may provide a missing link between recurrent novae and supersoft X-ray sources. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics Letters"
1732810,"Use of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect as a precise cosmological probe necessitates a realistic assessment of all possible contributions to Comptonization of the cosmic microwave background in clusters of galaxies. We have calculated the additional intensity change due to various possible populations of energetic electrons that have been proposed in order to account for measurements of intracluster radio, nonthermal X-ray and (possibly also) EUV emission. Our properly normalized estimates of (the highly model dependent value of) the predicted intensity change due to these electrons is well below $\sim 6%$ and $\sim 35%$ of the usual Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect due to electrons in the hot gas in Coma and A2199, respectively. These levels constitute high upper limits since they are based on energetic electron populations whose energy densities are {\it comparable} to those of the thermal gas. The main impact of nonthermal Comptonization is a shift of the crossover frequency (where the thermal effect vanishes) to higher values. Such a shift would have important consequences for our ability to measure cluster peculiar velocities from the kinematic component of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect."
1732811,"ABSTRACTI argue that cool giant components in most symbiotic binary systems possess magnetic activity on a much higher level than isolated cool giants or those in wide binary systems. Based on the behaviour of main-sequence stars, I assume that magnetic activity and X-ray luminosity increase with rotation velocity. I then show that the cool components in symbiotic systems are likely to rotate much faster than isolated, or in wide binary systems, cool giants. The magnetic activity of the cool giant may be observed as a global axisymmetrical mass-loss geometry of the cool giant (before the hot companion influences the outflow), a stochastic mass-loss process, i.e. a variation of mass-loss rate with time and location on the surface of the giant and in relatively strong X-ray emission. The variation in the mass-loss process from the cool giant may cause variation in the properties of jets blown by the hot compact companion. I conclude that symbiotic systems should be high-priority X-ray targets."
1732812,"We formulate a simple extension of general relativity which incorporates spacetime variations in the Newtonian gravitation ‘constant’, G, and the fine structure ‘constant’, α, which generalises Brans–Dicke theory and our theory of varying α. We determine the behaviour of Friedmann universes in this theory. In the radiation and dust-dominated eras αG approaches a constant value and the rate of variation of α is equal to the magnitude of the rate of variation in G. The expansion dynamics of the universe are dominated by the variation of G but the variation of G has significant effects upon the time variation of α. Time variations in α are extinguished by the domination of the expansion by spatial curvature or quintessence fields, as in the case with no G variation."
1732813,"We suggest that the collapsing core of a massive rotating star may fragment to produce two or more compact objects. Their coalescence under gravitational radiation gives the resulting black hole or neutron star a significant kick velocity, which may explain those observed in pulsars. A gamma-ray burst can result only when this kick is small. Thus only a small fraction of core-collapse supernovae produce gamma-ray bursts. The burst may be delayed significantly (hours - days) after the supernova, as suggested by recent observations. If this picture is correct, core-collapse supernovae should be significant sources of gravitational radiation with a chirp signal similar to a coalescing binary.

1732815,"We utilize the complimentary capabilities of XMM-Newton and Chandra, to conduct a detailed imaging and spectral study of the nearby galaxy NGC 4945 focussing on its nucleus and immediate surroundings (within ~1 kpc of the nucleus). A complex morphology is revealed including a predominantly hard, but partially resolved, nuclear source plus a spectrally soft, conically shaped X-ray ""plume"", which extends 30"" (500 pc) to the northwest. In NGC 4945 our direct view of the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is blocked below ~10 keV by extremely heavy line-of-sight absorption and the observed X-ray spectrum is dominated by multi-temperature thermal emission associated with the nuclear starburst and the X-ray plume. Nevertheless the signature of the AGN is present in the form of a neutral Compton reflection component and a 6.4 keV fluorescent iron Ka line. We conjecture that the site of the continuum reprocessing is the far wall of a highly inclined molecular torus, a geometry which is consistent with the presence of H2O megamaser emission in this source. The soft spectrum (~0.6 keV) and limb-brightened appearance of the X-ray plume suggest an interpretation in terms of a mass-loaded superwind emanating from the nuclear starburst.

We investigated the fast-time variability as a function of position on the Z track. During these observations, Sco X-2 traced out the most extensive Z track ever reported from this object, making this the most comprehensive study thus far. We found the broad peaked flaring branch noise that is typical of Sco X-2, with a centroid frequency in the range 3.3--5.8 Hz. We also discovered low frequency noise, and a new peaked noise feature, with centroid frequencies in the range 5.4--7.6 Hz and 11--54 Hz, respectively. We discuss the phenomenology of these features, their relationship with the power spectral components found in other low-mass X-ray binaries, and the implications for current models. In particular, the low frequency noise we observed was strongest at intermediate energies, in contrast to the low frequency noise seen in other Z sources. We also detected very low frequency noise, and have calculated complex cross spectra between intensity and hardness. We found that the very low frequency noise is not entirely due to motion along the Z track. Comment: 17 pages, 9 figures, minor improvements, accepted for publication in MNRAS"
1732817,"We propose a new method, emission-line eclipse mapping, to map the velocity fields of an accretion disk in position space. Quiescent dwarf novae usually exhibit double-peaked emission-line profiles because of disk rotation. Since a part of a disk having a different line-of-sight velocity is successively obscured by a companion in eclipsing systems, they show time-varying line profiles. We calculated the time changes of the emission-line profiles, assuming Keplerian rotation fields ($v_\varphi\propto r^{-1/2}$ with $r$ being the distance from the disk center) and an emissivity distribution of $j \propto r^{-3/2}$. We, then, applied the usual eclipse mapping technique to the light curves at each of 12–24 wavelengths across the line center to map the region with the same line-of-sight velocity. The reconstructed images typically exhibit a ‘two-eye’ pattern for high line-of-sight velocities, and we can recover the relation, $v_\varphi \propto d^{-1/2}$, on the assumption of an axisymmetric disk, where $d$ is the separation between the two ‘eyes’. We will be able to probe the Keplerian rotation law, the most fundamental assumption adopted in many disk models, by high-speed spectroscopic observations with 8-m class telescopes."

1732819,"The optical (BVRI) and radio (8.4 GHz) light curves of S5 1803+784 on a time span of nearly 6 years are presented and discussed. The optical light curve showed an overall variation greater than 3 mag, and the largest changes occured in three strong flares. No periodicity was found in the light curve on time scales up to a year. The variability in the radio band is very different, and shows moderate oscillations around an average constant flux density rather than relevant flares, with a maximum amplitude of ∼30%, without a simultaneous correspondence between optical and radio luminosity. The optical spectral energy distribution was always well fitted by a power law. The spectral index shows small variations and there is indication of a positive correlation with the source luminosity. Possible explanations of the source behaviour are discussed in the framework of current models."
1732820,"We sought to determine the scale of scintillation in the interstellar plasma of PSR J0437-4715. We used the Very Long Baseline Array to obtain scintillation amplitude and phase data, from dynamic spectra at 327 MHz. We observe two scales of scintillation of pulsar PSR J0437-4715, differing by more than an order of magnitude in scintillation bandwidth. The wider-bandwidth scale of scintillation that we observe indicates less scattering for this pulsar than for other nearby pulsars, except for PSR B0950+08."
1732821,In this comment we explain the discrepancy found between the results in arXiv:0712.1716v1 for the 3PN spin-spin potential and those previously derived in gr-qc/0604099. We point out that to compare one must include sub-leading lower order spin-orbit effects which contribute to the spin-spin potential once one transforms to the PN frame. When these effects are included the results in arXiv:0712.1716v1 do indeed reproduce those found in gr-qc/0604099.
1732822,"The interpretation of Fourier spectra in the time domain is critically examined. Power density spectra defined and calculated in the time domain are compared with Fourier spectra in the frequency domain for three different types of variability: periodic signals, Markov processes and random shots. The power density spectra for a sample of neutron stars and black hole binaries are analyzed in both the time and the frequency domains. For broadband noise, the two kinds of power spectrum in accreting neutron stars are usually consistent with each other, but the time domain power spectra for black hole candidates are significantly higher than corresponding Fourier spectra in the high frequency range (10--1000 Hz). Comparing the two kinds of power density spectra may help to probe the intrinsic nature of timing phenomena in compact objects. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures, to appear in Astrophysical Journal"
1732823,"Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) undergo changes in their pulse properties and persistent emission during episodes of intense burst activity. SGR 1900+14 has undergone large flux increases following recent burst activity. Both SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20 have shown significant changes in their pulse profile and spin-down rates during the last several years. The pulse profile changes are linked with the burst activity whereas the torque variations are not directly correlated with the bursts. Here, we review the observed dynamics of the pulsed and persistent emission of SGR 1900+14 and SGR 1806-20 during burst active episodes and discuss what implications these results have for the burst emission mechanism, the magnetic field dynamics of magnetars, the nature of the torque variability, and SGRs in general.

1732824,"A search for O VI at redshifts corresponding to Ly-alpha lines in the z_em ~ 2.4 QSOs HE1122-1648 and HE2217-2818 reveals that a substantial fraction of those with H I column densities log N(HI) > 14 (cm^{-2}) are highly ionized and show some heavy element enrichment. If these two sight lines are typical, then the O VI systems contain a cosmologically significant fraction of the baryons and the metals in the universe. For most systems the temperatures derived from the line widths are too low for collisional ionization to be responsible for the O VI lines. Photoionization models with a substantial hard ultraviolet flux can reproduce the observations for densities that are in good agreement with a model assuming local, hydrostatic equilibrium and heavy element abundances in the range ~ 10^{-3} - 10^{-2} solar. Photoionization by a UV flux much softer than that predicted by Haardt & Madau (1996) for a background dominated by quasars can be ruled out. Finally, we find one system with a very low H I column density for which both photoionization and collisional ionization models yield a metallicity close to solar and a density that is inconsistent with gravitational confinement, unless the gas fraction is negligible.

1732825,"We present a comprehensive study to determine whether the LINER/H II region transition spectrum in NGC 4569 can be generated solely by photoionization by the nuclear starburst. A review of the multiwavelength data from the literature reveals no additional sources that contribute to the ionization. We find that the young starburst dominating the UV emission is distinct from the nuclear population of A supergiants identified in the optical spectrum by W. Keel. Spectral synthesis analysis provides constraints on the physical nature of the starburst, revealing a 5–6 Myr, approximately instantaneous starburst with subsolar metallicity. These results are used to model the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing continuum. Luminosity constraints place limits on the steepness of the extinction curve for the young starburst. The Savage & Mathis curve satisfies all luminosity constraints and the derived reddening is similar to the emission-line reddening. These results imply extreme conditions in the nuclear starburst, with ~5 × 104 O and B stars compacted in the inner 9'' × 13'' region of the nucleus. Using photoionization analysis and employing all observational constraints on the emission-line gas, we find very specific conditions are required if the spectrum is generated solely by stellar photoionization. At least two spatially distinct components are required: a compact region with strong O III emission and an extended, low-density component emitting most of the S II flux. A high-density component is also needed to generate the O I flux. Additionally, a limited contribution from Wolf-Rayet stars to the ionizing SED is necessary, consistent with the results of a study by A. Barth and J. Shields. We present a physical interpretation for the multicomponent emission-line gas."
1732826,"At zero temperature and strong applied magnetic fields the ground sate of an anisotropic antiferromagnet is a saturated paramagnet with fully aligned spins. We study the quantum phase transition as the field is reduced below an upper critical $H_{c2}$ and the system enters a XY-antiferromagnetic phase. Using a bond operator representation we consider a model spin-1 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic with single-ion anisotropy in hyper-cubic lattices under strong magnetic fields. We show that the transition at $H_{c2}$ can be interpreted as a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons. The theoretical results are used to analyze our magnetization versus field data in the organic compound $NiCl_2$-$4SC(NH_2)_2$ (DTN) at very low temperatures. This is the ideal BEC system to study this transition since $H_{c2}$ is sufficiently low to be reached with static magnetic fields (as opposed to pulsed fields). The scaling of the magnetization as a function of field and temperature close to $H_{c2}$ shows excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. It allows to obtain the quantum critical exponents and confirm the BEC nature of the transition at $H_{c2}$. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figure. Accepted for publication in PRB,"
1732827,"We present diffraction-limited 2-25 micron images obtained with the W. M. Keck 10-m telescopes that spatially resolve the cool source, IRS 21, one of a small group of enigmatic objects in the central parsec of our Galaxy that have eluded classification. Modeled as a Gaussian, the azimuthally-averaged intensity profile of IRS 21 has a half-width half-maximum (HWHM) size of 650+/-80 AU at 2.2 microns and an average HWHM size of 1600+/-200 AU at mid-infrared wavelengths. These large apparent sizes imply an extended distribution of dust. The mid-infrared color map indicates that IRS 21 is a self-luminous source rather than an externally heated dust clump as originally suggested. The spectral energy distribution has distinct near- and mid-infrared components. A simple radiative transfer code, which simultaneously fits the near- and mid- infrared photometry and intensity profiles, supports a model in which the near-infrared radiation is scattered and extincted light from an embedded central source, while the mid-infrared emission is from thermally re-radiating silicate dust. We argue that IRS 21 (and by analogy the other luminous sources along the Northern Arm) is a massive star experiencing rapid mass loss and plowing through the Northern Arm, thereby generating a bow shock, which is spatially resolved in our observations.

1732828,"We address a numerical instability that arises in the directionally split computation of hydrodynamic flows when shock fronts are parallel to a grid plane. Transverse oscillations in pressure, density and temperature are produced that are exacerbated by thermal instability when cooling is present, forming post--shock `stripes'. These are orthogonal to the classic post--shock 'ringing' fluctuations. The resulting post--shock `striping' substantially modifies the flow. We discuss three different methods to resolve this problem. These include (1) a method based on artificial viscosity; (2) grid--jittering and (3) a new localized oscillation filter that acts on specific grid cells in the shock front. These methods are tested using a radiative wall shock problem with an embedded shear layer. The artificial viscosity method is unsatisfactory since, while it does reduce post--shock ringing, it does not eliminate the stripes and the excessive shock broadening renders the calculation of cooling inaccurate, resulting in an incorrect shock location. Grid--jittering effectively counteracts striping. However, elsewhere on the grid, the shear layer is unphysically diffused and this is highlighted in an extreme case. The oscillation filter method removes stripes and permits other high velocity gradient regions of the flow to evolve in a physically acceptable manner. It also has the advantage of only acting on a small fraction of the cells in a two or three dimensional simulation and does not significantly impair performance."
1732829,"According to the discussion on Birkhoff's theorem by Peebles (1993), a void with a negative perturbation \delta may evolve as a separate homogeneous universe with a local expansion parameter H_V\simeq H_0(1-\delta/3). This slightly low density ``universe'' will diverge from the mean, producing a void of ever lower density. As a result, the contents of voids will ``fall'' outward at a velocity equal to the difference between the local, and the mean expansion parameters times the radius of the void. Observational constraints on the outfall velocity can be placed as a result of the fortuitous event that void, and non-void hydrogen LyA absorbers have distinct characteristics -- both in their equivalent width distributions and their Doppler parameter distributions -- which are clearly distinguished when cloud environments are measured in terms of the sum of the tidal fields of surrounding galaxies acting on the cloud (Manning 2002). These constraints dictate that the radial outfall velocity from an average void of radius ~ 15 h_{75}^{-1} Mpc must be less than \~100 km/s. The implications of this are probed with a ``negative'' top-hat simulation, using a 1-D Lagrangian code, to determine the relationship between the mass deficit in voids and the local expansion parameter in a flat lambda cosmology. The outfall velocity constraint shows that the void matter density must be greater than 75% of the mean matter density. I argue that this implies that \Omega_m >~ 0.86$. Thus the total amount of matter in voids is of order twice the total mass in the filamentary structures."

1732831,"We discuss the implication of the observation of supernova relic neutrinos on the study of the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies. The limit recently obtained at Super-Kamiokande (SK) is already marginally significant: The SFR we derived $\psi(t_0)<0.040M_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$(at a 90% CL) is about twice the SFR estimated from radio observations, and five times the rate from H$\alpha$ allowing for uncertainties in the model supernova neutrino flux.

1732833,"Though widely observed to be emanating out from a variety of galactic and extra-galactic sources, the underlying physical mechanism behind the formation of the cosmic jets and outflows are wrapped around by the veil of mystery till date. Neither the amount of matter contained in these jets could accurately be calculated by any definitive method. In this paper we present a theoretical model, which, for the first time we believe, is able to explain the jet formation phenomenon as well as can compute the mass outflow rate by self-consistently combining the exact transonic accretion-outflow topologies. Our model could also analyze the dependence of this rate on various physical parameters governing the inflow."
1732834,"Statistical analyses of observed galaxy distortions are often used to reconstruct the mass distribution of an intervening cluster responsible for gravitational lensing. In current projects, distortions of thousands of source galaxies have to be handled efficiently; much larger data bases and more massive investigations are envisaged for new major observational initiatives. In this article we present an efficient mass reconstruction procedure, a direct method that solves a variational principle noted in an earlier paper, which, for rectangular fields, turns out to reduce the relevant execution time by a factor from 100 to 1000 with respect to the fastest methods currently used, so that for grid numbers N = 400 the required CPU time on a good workstation can be kept within the order of 1 second. The acquired speed also opens the way to some long-term projects based on simulated observations (addressing statistical or cosmological questions) that would be, at present, practically not viable for intrinsically slow reconstruction methods."
1732835,"We have used the VLA to conduct a deep search for 3.6 cm radio emission from nearby very low mass stars and brown dwarfs. The Gudel-Benz relation is used to predict radio luminosities for some very low mass stars and candidate brown dwarfs with measured X-ray fluxes. The predicted radio fluxes are quite small, whereas the measured radio flux from the brown dwarf candidate Rho Oph GY 31 is relatively strong. In light of our new observations, this object remains an anomaly. We present upper limits for our measured radio fluxes at 3.6 cm for our targets. Comment: 10 pages, no figures.

1732836,"We use the saddle-approach, recently introduced in the numerical investigation of simple model liquids, in the analysis of a mean-field solvable system. The investigated system is the k-trigonometric model, a k-body interaction mean field system, that generalizes the trigonometric model introduced by Madan and Keyes [J. Chem. Phys. 98, 3342 (1993)] and that has been recently introduced to investigate the relationship between thermodynamics and topology of the configuration space. We find a close relationship between the properties of saddles (stationary points of the potential energy surface) visited by the system and the dynamics. In particular the temperature dependence of saddle order follows that of the diffusivity, both having an Arrhenius behavior at low temperature and a similar shape in the whole temperature range. Our results confirm the general usefulness of the saddle-approach in the interpretation of dynamical processes taking place in interacting systems. Comment: 7 pages, 8 figures"

The 'Parallel Time Varying & Data Super-helical Access Memory' (PTVD-SHAM), possesses a waterfall effect in its architecture dealing with the process of voltage output-switch into diverse logic and quantum states described as 'Boolean logic & image-logic', respectively. Quantum dot computational methods are explained by utilizing coiled carbon nanotubes (CCNTs) and CNT field effect transistors (CNFETs) in the chip's architecture. Quantum confinement, categorized quantum well substrate, and B-field flux involvements are discussed in theory.

1732840,"We describe the observing simulation software FISVI (FIS Virtual Instrument), which was developed for the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) that will be on the Japanese infrared astronomy mission ASTRO-F. The FISVI has two purposes: one is to check the specifications and performances of the ASTRO-F/FIS as a whole; the other is to prepare input data sets for the data analysis softwares prior to launch. In the FISVI, special care was taken by introducing the “Compiled PSF (Point Spread Function)” to optimise inevitable, but time-consuming, convolution processes. With the Compiled PSF, we reduce the computation time by an order of magnitude. The photon and readout noises are included in the simulations. We estimate the detection limits for point sources from the simulation of virtual patches of the sky mostly consisting of distant galaxies. We studied the importance of source confusion for simple power-law models for $N (\gt S)$, the number of sources brighter than $S$. We found that source confusion plays a dominant role in the detection limits only for models with rapid luminosity evolution for the galaxy counts, the evolution of which is suggested by recent observations."
1732841,"The purpose of this article is to show that when dynamically cold, dissipationless self-gravitating systems collapse, their evolution is a strong function of the symmetry in the initial distribution. We explore with a set of pressure-less homogeneous fluids the time-evolution of ellipsoidal distributions and map the depth of potential achieved during relaxation as function of initial ellipsoid axis ratios. We then perform a series of $N$-body numerical simulations and contrast their evolution with the fluid solutions. We verify an analytic relation between collapse factor ${\cal C}$ and particle number $N$ in spherical symmetry, such that ${\cal C} \propto N^{1/3}$. We sought a similar relation for axisymmetric configurations, and found an empirical scaling relation such that ${\cal C} \propto N^{1/6}$ in these cases. We then show that when mass distributions do not respect spherical- or axial-symmetry, the ensuing gravitational collapse deepens with increasing particle number $N$ but only slowly: 86% of triaxial configurations may collapse by a factor of no more than 40 as $N\to\infty$. For $N\approx 10^5$ and larger, violent relaxation develops fully under the Lin-Mestel-Shu instability such that numerical $N$-body solutions now resolve the different initial morphologies adequately.

1732843,"Using a highly accurate numerical code, we study the spin down of rotating relativistic stars, undergoing a quark deconfinement phase transition. Such phase transitions have been suggested to yield an observable signal in the braking index of spinning-down pulsars, which is based on a ``backbending'' behaviour of the moment of inertia. We focus on a particular equation of state that has been used before to study this behaviour, and find that for the population of normal pulsars the moment of inertia does not exhibit a backbending behaviour. In contrast, for supramassive millisecond pulsars a very strong backbending behaviour is found. Essentially, once a quark core appears in a spinning-down supramassive millisecond pulsar, the star spins up and continues to do so until it reaches the instability to collapse. This strong spin-up behaviour makes it easier to distinguish a phase transition in such pulsars: a negative first time-derivative of the rotational period suffices and one does not have to measure the braking index. In the spin-up era, the usually adopted spin-down power law fails to describe the evolution of the angular velocity. We adopt a general-relativistic spin-down power law and derive the equations that describe the angular velocity and braking index evolution in rapidly rotating pulsars.

It should have an apparent companion, a long period (1118d) red variable, belonging to IC 1613.

1732846,"Galaxy masses can be estimated by a variety of methods, each applicable in different circumstances and each suffering from different systematic uncertainties. Confirmation of results obtained by one technique with analysis by another is particularly important. Recent Sloan Digital Sky Survey weak-lensing measurements of the projected mass correlation function reveal a linear relation between galaxy luminosities and the depth of their dark matter halos (measured on 260 h-1 kpc scales). In this work we use an entirely independent dynamical method to confirm these results. We begin by assembling a sample of 618 relatively isolated host galaxies, surrounded by a total of 1225 substantially fainter satellites. We observe the mean dynamical effect of these hosts on the motions of their satellites by assembling velocity difference histograms. Dividing the sample by host properties, we find significant variations in satellite velocity dispersion with host luminosity. We quantify these variations using a simple dynamical model, measuring a dynamical mass M within 260 h-1 kpc. The appropriateness of this mass reconstruction is checked by conducting a similar analysis within an N-body simulation. Comparison between the dynamical and lensing mass-to-light scalings shows reasonable agreement, providing some quantitative confirmation for the lensing results."

1732849,"The deuterium abundance evaluation in the direction of Capella has for a long time been used as a reference for the local interstellar medium (ISM) within our Galaxy. We show here that broad and weak HI components could be present on the Capella line of sight, leading to a large new additional systematic uncertainty on the N(HI) evaluation. The D/H ratio toward Capella is found to be equal to 1.67 (+/-0.3)x10^-5 with almost identical chi^2 for all the fits (this range includes only the systematic error; the 2 sigma statistical one is almost negligible in comparison). It is concluded that D/H evaluations over HI column densities below 10^19 cm^-2 (even perhaps below 10^20 cm^-2 if demonstrated by additional observations) may present larger uncertainties than previously anticipated. It is mentionned that the D/O ratio might be a better tracer for DI variations in the ISM as recently measured by the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE).

1732850,An attempt is made to set constraints on the otherwise ambiguous decomposition of the rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies into contributions due to the various components of the galaxies. For this purpose galaxies are selected which show clear spiral structure. Arguments of density wave theory of galactic spiral arms are then used to estimate the masses of the galactic disks. These estimates seem to indicate that the disks of low surface brightness galaxies might be much more massive than currently thought. This unexpected result contradicts stellar population synthesis models. This would also mean that low surface brightness galaxies are not dominated by dark matter in their inner parts.
1732851,"A search for solar axions has been performed using an axion helioscope which is equipped with a 2.3-m long 4 T superconducting magnet, PIN-photodiode X-ray detectors, and a telescope mount mechanism to track the sun.

From the absence of any evidence, analysis sets a limit on axion–photon coupling constant to be for the axion mass of at 95% confidence level, which is more stringent than the limit inferred from the solar-age consideration. This result gives currently the most stringent observational limit on the existence of solar axions in this mass region."
1732852,"Recently the OGLE experiment has provided accurate light curves and colours for about 2 millions stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We have examined this database for its content of Be stars, applying some selection criteria, and we have found a sample of $\sim$ 1000 candidates. Some of these stars show beautiful light curves with amazing variations never observed in any Galactic variable. We find outbursts in 13% of the sample (Type-1 stars), high and low states in 15%, periodic variations in 7%, and the usual variations seen in Galactic Be stars in 65% of the cases. The Galactic counterparts of Type-1 objects could be the outbursting Be stars found by Hubert & Floquet (1998) after the analysis of Hipparcos photometry. We discuss the possibility that Type-1 stars could correspond to Be stars with accreting white dwarf companions or alternatively, blue pre-main sequence stars surrounded by thermally unstable accretion disks. We provide coordinates and basic photometric information for these stars and some examples of light curves. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics"
1732853,"We present a two-dimensional version of the classical one-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, extending an earlier idea due to Peacock (1983) and an implementation proposed by Fasano & Franceschini (1987). The two-dimensional K-S test is used to optimise the goodness of fit in an iterative source-detection scheme for astronomical images. The method is applied to a ROSAT/HRI x-ray image of the post core-collapse globular cluster NGC 6397 to determine the most probable source distribution in the cluster core. Comparisons to other widely-used source detection methods, and to a Chandra image of the same field, show that our iteration scheme is superior in measuring statistics-limited sources in severely crowded fields.

1732854,"The past century of interstellar dust has brought us from first ignoring it to finding that it is an important component of the interstellar medium and plays an important role in the evolution of galaxies, the formation of stars and planetary systems, and possibly, the origins of life. Current observational results in our galaxy provide a complex physical and chemical evolutionary picture of interstellar dust starting with the formation of small refractory particles in stellar atmospheres to their modification in diffuse and molecular clouds and ultimately to their contribution to star forming regions. In this review, a brief history of the studies of interstellar dust is presented. Our current understanding of the physical and chemical properties of interstellar dust are summarized, based on observational evidences from interstellar extinction, absorption, scattering, polarization, emission (luminescence, infrared vibrational emission, and microwave rotational emission), interstellar depletions, and theoretical modelling. Some unsolved outstanding problems are listed."
1732855,"In the framework of the silicate core-carbonaceous organic mantle interstellar dust model, the bulk of the visual/near-IR extinction and the entire polarization are from nonspherical and aligned core-mantle grains. The 3.4 micron C-H and 9.7 micron Si-O absorption features, respectively arising from the hydrocarbon mantle and the amorphous silicate core, are expected to be polarized to a modestly different degree. Spectropolarimetric observations toward the same lines of sight both in the 3.4 micron region and in the 9.7 micron region would be of great value to test the core-mantle dust model. The fact that the 3.4 micron feature is not polarized along the line of sight toward the Galactic center source IRS 7 is not yet sufficient to reject the core-mantle model due to the lack of spectropolarimetric observation of this region in the 9.7 micron region.

1732856,"Analyses of the inelastic α+12C scattering at medium energies have indicated that the strength of the Hoyle state (the isoscalar excitation at 7.65 MeV in 12C) seems to exhaust only 7–9% of the monopole energy weighted sum rule (EWSR), compared to about 15% of the EWSR extracted from inelastic electron scattering data. The full monopole transition strength predicted by realistic microscopic α-cluster models of the Hoyle state can be shown to exhaust up to 22% of the EWSR. To explore the missing monopole strength in the inelastic α+12C scattering, we have performed a fully microscopic folding model analysis of the inelastic α+12C scattering at Elab=104–240 MeV using the 3-α resonating group wave function of the Hoyle state obtained by Kamimura, and a complex density-dependent M3Y interaction newly parametrized based on the Brueckner–Hartree–Fock results for nuclear matter. Our folding model analysis has shown consistently that the missing monopole strength of the Hoyle state is not associated with the uncertainties in the analysis of the α+12C scattering, but is most likely due to the short lifetime and weakly bound structure of this state which significantly enhances absorption in the exit channel."
1732857,"We study the boundedness on $L^p$ of the Riesz transform $\nabla L^{-1/2}$, where $L$ is one of several operators defined on $\R$ or $\R_+$, endowed with the measure $r^{d-1} dr$, $d > 1$, where $dr$ is Lebesgue measure. For integer $d$, this mimics the measure on Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, and in this case our setup is equivalent to looking at the Laplacian acting on radial functions on Euclidean space or variations of Euclidean space such as the exterior of a sphere (with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions), or the connected sum of two copies of $\R^d$. In this way we illuminate some recent results on the Riesz transform on asymptotically Euclidean manifolds. We are however interested in all real values of $d > 1$, and another goal of our analysis is to study the range of boundedness as a function of $d$; it is particularly interesting to see the behaviour as $d$ crosses 2. For example, in one of our cases which models radial functions on the connected sum of two copies of $\R^d$, the upper threshold for $L^p$ boundedness is $p=d$ for $d \ge 2$ and $p=d/(d-1)$ for $d < 2$. Only in the case $d=2$ is the Riesz transform actually bounded on $L^p$ when $p$ is equal to the upper threshold. We also study the Riesz transform when we have an inverse square potential, or a delta function potential; these cases provide a simple model for recent results of the first author and Guillarmou. Finally we look at the Hodge projector in a slightly more general setup."
1732858,"The Dzialoshinskii model of periodic and helicoidal structures has been analyzed without neglecting of the amplitude function oscillations. The amplitude function oscillations are shown to be important for understanding of the nature of the phase function. Analytic consideration is carried out in the limit of small anisotropy (neglecting the cosine term in the Hamiltonian). Surprisingly, the phase jumps survive even in the limit of the vanishing anisotropy."
1732859,"We introduce multipole soliton complexes in optical lattices induced by nondiffracting parabolic beams. Despite the symmetry breaking dictated by the curvature of the lattice channels, we find that complex, asymmetric higher-order states can be stable. The unique topology of parabolic lattices affords new types of soliton motion: single solitons launched into the lattice with nonzero transverse momentum perform periodic oscillations along parabolic paths."
1732860,"The assumption of additive absorptivity by different components in compound particles is a widely used method applied in the literature to the analysis of the chemical and structural properties of astronomical (circumstellar, interstellar, protostellar and cometary) silicates as well as other materials. The errors intrinsic in this additivity assumption, which, in application to astronomical spectra, amounts in some cases to spectrum subtraction, have not always been adequately considered in previous works on silicate mineralogy. The failings in the ‘spectrum subtraction method’ (intrinsically the same as the additive absorptivity assumption) are discussed here in terms of silicate core–ice mantle grains with various shapes. It is shown that these assumptions result in substantial errors for spherical grains. For spheroidal grains, the errors are less significant and the spectrum subtraction method can be used to remove the ice mantle effects. It is demonstrated that there is no significant improvement by considering a distribution of spheroidal shapes. It is further shown that the presence of additional organic mantles substantially modifies the silicate mineralogy interpretation."
1732861,"We present the results of a deep search for the molecular hydrogen shock fronts associated with young stellar outflows in the giant molecular cloud and massive star-forming region W51. A total of 14 outflows were identified by comparing images in the H and K bands and in a narrowband filter centered on the H2 1-0 S(1) line at 2.122 μm. A few of the newly discovered outflows were subsequently imaged at higher spatial resolution in the S(1) filter; one outflow was also imaged in the 1.644 μm emission line of [Fe II]. For two of the outflows, high-resolution echelle spectroscopy in the H2 1-0 S(1) line was obtained using NIRSPEC at Keck. For one outflow additional high-resolution spectra were obtained in the [Fe II] line and in Brγ. The largest and best-studied outflow shock front shows a remarkably broad [Fe II] line, an unusual high-velocity component in Brγ, and comparably narrow line widths in the H2 1-0 S(1) line. A scenario involving high-velocity shocks and UV excitation of preshock material is used to explain these spectra."
1732862,"We present molecular line and submillimeter dust continuum observations of the Lynds 870 cloud in the vicinity of IRAS 20231+3440. Two submillimeter cores, SMM1 and SMM2, are identified mapping the 870 micron dust continuum and ammonia emission. The total molecular mass is ~70-110 solar mass. The northern core is warmer and denser than the southern one. Molecular outflows are discovered in both cores. In the northern one a significant amount of low velocity (1.3-2.8 km/s) outflowing gas is found, that is hidden in the relatively broad CO lines but that is revealed by the narrower HCO+ spectra. While IRAS 20231+3440 is most likely the exciting star of the northern outflow, the driving source of the southern outflow is not detected by infrared surveys and must be deeply embedded in the cloud core. Large scale (~0.2 pc) infall motion is indicated by blue asymmetric profiles observed in the HCO+ J = 3-2 spectra. Red K_s band YSO candidates revealed by the 2MASS survey indicate ongoing star formation throughout the cloud. The calculated masses and the measured degree of turbulence are also reminiscent of clouds forming groups of stars. The excitation of the molecular lines, molecular abundances, and outflow properties are discussed. It is concluded that IRAS 20231+3440 is a ClassI object, while the southern core most likely contains a Class0 source. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A"
1732863,"Coalescing binary neutron stars (NS) are expected to be an important source of gravitational waves (GW) detectable by laser interferometers. We present here a simple method for determining the compactness ratio M/R of NS based on the observed deviation of the GW energy spectrum from point-mass behavior at the end of inspiral. Our method is based on the properties of quasiequilibrium binary NS sequences and does not require the computation of the full GW signal h(t). Combined with the measurement of the NS masses during inspiral, the determination of M/R will allow very strong constraints to be placed on the equation of state of dense nuclear matter."
1732864,"Star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) Draco, Sextans, and Ursa Minor are investigated by means of chemical evolution models and a simulation code for colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The CMD simulation code is designed to fully consider effects of the chemical evolution on stellar evolution and photometric properties. Comparisons between the chemical evolution models and the observed abundance patterns reveal that the star formation rates were very low (1-5% of that of the solar neighbourhood disc) and that the initial star formation continued for a long duration (> 3.9-6.5 Gyr) in these dSphs. This star formation history can reproduce morphologies of the observed CMDs, such as narrow red giant branches and red horizontal branches. Hence, both of the abundance patterns and the morphologies of the CMDs can be explained by the star formation histories characterised by the low star formation rate and the long duration of the star formation period. Because of the low star formation rates, plenty of gas remains at the final epoch of star formation. We suggest that gas stripping by the Galaxy results in termination of star formation in the dSphs.

1732865,"High-resolution simulations are used to map out the detailed structure of two long-lived stable belts of asteroid orbits in the inner Solar system. The Vulcanoid belt extends from 0.09 to 0.20 au, though with a gaps at 0.15 and 0.18 au corresponding to de-stabilizing mean motion resonances with Mercury and Venus. As collisional evolution proceeds slower at larger heliocentric distances, km-sized or larger Vulcanoids are most likely to be found in the region between 0.16 and 0.18 au. The optimum location to search is at geocentric ecliptic longitudes 9°≤∣ℓg∣≤10° and latitudes ∣βg∣<1°. Dynamically speaking, the Earth–Mars belt between 1.08 and 1.28 au is a stable repository for asteroids on nearly circular orbits. It is interrupted at 1.21 au owing to the 3:4 commensurability with the Earth, while secular resonances with Saturn are troublesome beyond 1.17 au. These detailed maps of the fine structure of the belts can be used to plan search methodologies. Strategies for detecting members of the belts are discussed, including the use of infrared wide-field imaging with VISTA, and forthcoming European Space Agency satellite missions such as GAIA and BepiColombo."
1732866,"Creation of electron-positron pairs near the pulsar surface and the parameters of plasma in pulsar magnetospheres are discussed. It is argued that the pair creation process is nonstationary, and the pair plasma that flows out from the pulsar environment is strongly nonhomogeneous and gathers into separate clouds. Plasma instabilities in the outflowing plasma are reviewed. The two-stream instability that develops due to strong nonhomogeneity of the outflowing plasma is the most plausible reason for the generation of coherent radio emission of pulsars. The development of the two-stream instability in pulsar magnetospheres is considered."
1732867,"We present high resolution UVES+VLT spectroscopic observations of 56 stars in the extended horizontal branch (EHB) of the Galactic globular clusters NGC 1904, NGC 2808, NGC 6093, and NGC 7078. Our data reveal for the first time the presence in NGC 1904 of a sizable population of fast (vsini > 20 km/s) horizontal branch (HB) rotators, confined to the cool end of the EHB, similar to that found in M13. We also confirm the fast rotators already observed in NGC 7078. The cooler stars (Teff < 11,500 K) in these three clusters show a range of rotation rates, with a group of stars rotating at ~ 15 km/s or less, and a fast rotating group at ~ 30 km/s. Apparently, the fast rotators are relatively more abundant in NGC 1904 and M13, than in NGC 7078. No fast rotators have been identified in NGC 2808 and NGC 6093. All the stars hotter than Teff ~ 11,500 K have projected rotational velocities vsini < 12 km/s, but less than 20% have vsini < 2 km/s. The connection between photometric gaps in the HB and the change in the projected rotational velocities is not confirmed by the new data. However, our data are consistent with a relation between this discontinuity and the HB jump. We discuss a number of possibilities for the origin of the stellar rotation distribution along the HB. We conclude that none of them can yet provide a satisfactory explanation of the observations. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures, ApJ Letter, accepted"
1732868,"We report on the current operating status of the ROTSE‐IIIa telescope, currently undergoing testing at Los Alamos National Laboratories in New Mexico. It will be shipped to Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, in first quarter 2002. ROTSE‐IIIa has been in automated observing mode since early October, 2001, after completing several weeks of calibration and check‐out observations. Calibrated lists of objects in ROTSE‐IIIa sky patrol data are produced routinely in an automated pipeline, and we are currently automating analysis procedures to compile these lists, eliminate false detections, and automatically identify transient and variable objects. The manual application of these procedures has already led to the detection of a nova that rose over six magnitudes in two days to a maximum detected brightness of m R ∼ 13.9 and then faded two magnitudes in two weeks. We also readily identify variable stars, includings those suspected to be variables from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We report on our system to allow public monitoring of the telescope operational status in real time over the WWW."
1732869,"We compute the hard X-ray spectra from a hot plasma pervaded by small cold dense clouds. The main cooling mechanism of the plasma is Compton cooling by the soft thermal emission from the clouds. We compute numerically the equilibrium temperature of the plasma together with the escaping spectrum. The spectrum depends mainly on the amount of cold clouds filling the hot phase. The clouds covering factor is constrained to be low in order to produce spectra similar to those observed in Seyfert galaxies and X-ray binaries, implying that an external reflector is required in order to reproduce the full range of observed reflection amplitudes. We also derive analytical estimates for the X-ray spectral slope and reflection amplitude using an escape probability formalism. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"
1732870,"In models for gamma ray burst afterglows, it is normally assumed that the external shock strongly amplifies the magnetic field and that this field maintains a steady value throughout the shocked region. We discuss the effects of modifying this (probably simplistic) assumption by allowing for a short decay time. The observations are incompatible with a post-shock field that decays too rapidly. However if the field pervades only a few percent of the total thickness of the shocked shell (and the electrons undergo only inverse Compton losses in the remainder) the model could be compatible with data. This would suggest a strong dependence of model parameters on the uncertainties of shock physics, therefore calling for independent external density estimates. We claim that afterglow emission should be instead seen as a laboratory where we can understand relativistic shock physics. The model we propose here together with afterglow observations in all wavebands could help to pin down the field structure.

1732871,"The FREGATE gamma ray detector of HETE-2 is sensitive to photons between 6 and 400 keV. This sensitivity range, extended towards low energies, allows us to explore the emission of GRBs in hard X-rays. We fit the spectra of 23 GRBs with Band's spectral function in order to derive the distribution of their peak energies (E-peak). This distribution is then compared with the E-peak distributions measured by BATSE and GINGA. Comment: 3 pages, Woods Hole Proceedings"
1732872,"We present a small data base of homogeneously derived photospheric element abundances of DZ white dwarfs and related objects. Our previous investigations are supplemented with the analysis of ultraviolet spectra for nine white dwarfs. Of particular interest is the detection of Lalpha absorption in van Maanen 2 and a determination of the effective temperature of this star. The new value is about 1000K lower than previous results due to the strong ultraviolet absorption by metals which has to be considered consistently. The metal abundances of our sample stars are compatible with the predictions from the two-phase accretion model of Dupuis et al. (1992, 1993). Small deviations can be observed for the abundance ratios in some objects. This could indicate non-solar metal-to-metal ratios in the accreted material. Hydrogen can be detected in virtually all of our objects. However, its average accretion rate must be at least two orders of magnitude lower than the metal accretion rate."
1732873,"We propose a new generalisation of general relativity which incorporates a variation in both the speed of light in vacuum (c) and the gravitational constant (G) and which is both covariant and Lorentz invariant. We solve the generalised Einstein equations for Friedmann universes and show that arbitrary time-variations of c and G never lead to a solution to the flatness, horizon or Λ problems for a theory satisfying the strong energy condition. In order to do so, one needs to construct a theory which does not reduce to the standard one for any choice of time, length and energy units. This can be achieved by breaking a number of invariance principles such as covariance and Lorentz invariance."
1732874,"If cosmic rays with energies <100 TeV originate in the galaxy and are accelerated in shock waves in shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs), gamma-rays will be produced as the result of proton and electron interactions with the local interstellar medium, and by inverse Compton emission from electrons scattering soft photon fields. We report on observations of two supernova remnants with the Whipple Observatory's 10 m gamma-ray telescope. No significant detections have been made and upper limits on the >500 GeV flux are reported. Non-thermal X-ray emission detected from one of these remnants (Cassiopeia A) has been interpreted as synchrotron emission from electrons in the ambient magnetic fields. Gamma-ray emission detected from the Monoceros/Rosette Nebula region has been interpreted as evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration. We interpret our results in the context of these observations."
1732875,"We present a quantitative analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of the Local Group dSph galaxy Leo I, from the information in its HST [(V-I),I] color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The method we use is based in comparing, via synthetic CMDs, the expected distribution of stars in the CMD for different evolutionary scenarios, with the observed distribution. We consider the SFH to be composed by the SFR(t), the Z(t), the IMF, and a function $\beta(f,q)$, controlling the fraction $f$ and mass ratio distribution $q$ of binary stars. The comparison between the observed CMD and the model CMDs is done through chi-square minimization of the differences in the number of stars in a set of regions of the CMD. Our solution for the SFH of Leo I defines a minimum of chi-square in a well defined position of the parameter space, and the derived SFR(t) is robust, in the sense that its main characteristics are unchanged for different combinations of the remaining parameters. However, only a narrow range of assumptions for Z(t), IMF and $\beta(f,q)$ result in a good agreement between the data and the models, namely: Z=0.0004, a Kroupa et al. (1993) IMF or slightly steeper, and a relatively large fraction of binary stars. Most star formation activity (70% to 80%) occurred between 7 and 1 Gyr ago. At 1 Gyr ago, it abruptly dropped to a negligible value, but seems to have been active until at least ~ 300 Myr ago. Our results don't unambiguously answer the question of whether Leo I began forming stars around 15 Gyr ago, but it appears that the amount of this star formation, if existing at all, would be small.

1732877,"We report the discovery of millisecond oscillations in the X-ray emission from the X-ray transient SAX J1750.8-2900. Millisecond quasiperiodic oscillations (kHz QPOs) were present in the persistent emission with frequencies ranging from 543 Hz to 1017 Hz. Oscillations at a frequency of 600.75 Hz were present in the brightest X-ray burst observed. We derive an upper limit on the source distance of 6.3 +/- 0.7 kpc from this X-ray burst.

1732878,"We present homogeneous age determinations for a large sample of 55 Galactic globular clusters, which constitute about 30% of the total Galactic population. A study of their age distribution reveals that all clusters from the most metal poor ones up to intermediate metallicities are coeval, whereas at higher [Fe/H] an age spread exists, together with an age-metallicity relationship. At the same time, all clusters within a certain galactocentric distance appear coeval, whereas an age spread is present further away from the Galactic centre, without any correlation with distance. The precise value of [Fe/H] and galactocentric distance for the onset of the age spread and the slope of the age-metallicity relationship are strongly affected by the as yet uncertain [Fe/H] scale. We discuss how differences in the adopted [Fe/H] scale and cluster sample size may explain discrepant results about the clusters age distribution reached by different authors. Taking advantage of the large number of objects included in our sample, we also tested the possibility that age is the global second parameter which determines the Horizontal Branch morphology, and found indications that age could explain the global behaviour of the second parameter effect."

The detector is eight lithium fluoride bolometers with a total mass of 168 g and aims for the direct detection of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) via spin-dependent interaction. With an exposure of 4.1 kg days, we derived the limits in the ap–an (WIMP–nucleon couplings) plane and excluded a large part of the parameter space allowed by the UKDMC experiment."
1732880,Type Ia supernovae are an important tool for studying the expansion history of the universe. Advancing our yet incomplete understanding of the explosion scenario requires detailed and realistic numerical models in order to interpret and analyze the growing amount of observational data. Here we present first results of our new NLTE model calculations for the expanding atmospheres of type Ia supernovae that employ a detailed and consistent treatment of all important NLTE effects as well as line blocking and blanketing. The comparison of the synthetic spectra resulting from these models with observed data shows that the employed methods represent an important step towards a more realistic description of the atmospheres of supernovae Ia.
1732881,"Double bars have been proposed as a means of transporting molecular gas past inner Lindblad resonances into the nuclear regions, where it can fuel active or starburst nuclei. Thus far, the existence of double bars has been determined predominantly through analysis of near infrared images, which can tell us little about the dynamics and inflow rates of these systems. We have observed two double bar galaxy candidates (NGC 2273 and NGC 5728) in CO J=1-0 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Millimeter Array. Despite the similarity in the near infrared images of these galaxies, we see rather different nuclear morphologies in the CO maps. NGC 2273 shows evidence of a nuclear gas bar, aligned with the nuclear stellar bar seen in the near infrared images. Both the nuclear gaseous and stellar bars are misaligned from the large scale bar by approximately 90 degrees, which also allows the possibility that both are the result of stars and gas populating the $x_2$ orbits of the primary bar. Estimates using dynamical friction arguments and star formation rates suggest significant gas inflow rates along the nuclear bar of NGC 2273. Conversely, NGC 5728 does not show any evidence for a nuclear molecular bar, but shows an arc of CO clumps that peaks just to the south-west of the dynamical center and curves to the south-east where it follows the dust lane to the south. Models of double-barred galaxies suggest that these galaxies should contain large amounts of molecular gas in their nuclei. Our calculations suggest that both galaxies contain sufficient amounts of gas in their nuclei, but only NGC 2273 shows evidence for a nuclear gas bar. This may be the result of past episodes of star formation exhausting and dispersing the nuclear gas of NGC 5728, but is more likely evidence that NGC 5728 has undergone a minor merger event.

1732882,"We use the tapering effect of Halpha/[NII] rotation curves of spiral galaxies first noted by Goad & Roberts (1981) to investigate the internal extinction in disks. The scale length of exponential fits to the inner part of rotation curves depends strongly on the disk axial ratio. Preliminary modelling of the effect implies substantial opacity of the central parts of disks at a wavelength of 0.66 \mu. In addition, the average kinematic scale length of rotation curves, when corrected to face--on perspective, has a nearly constant value of about 1.7 h^{-1} kpc, for all luminosity classes. The interpretation of that effect, as the result of the increasing dominance of the baryonic mass in the inner parts of galaxies, yields a mean baryonic mass--to--light ratio in the I band \Upsilon_I= 2.7h M_sun/L_{sun,I}, within the inner 1.7 h^{-1} kpc of disks.

1732883,"We present images of the supernova remnant N206 in the LMC, taken with ATCA at wavelengths of 3 and 6 cm. Based on our data and previously published flux densities, the spectral index of N206 is -0.20 +- 0.07. The 6-cm radio morphology shows a filled center. Most interesting is the discovery of a peculiar linear feature previously undetected at any wavelength. The feature lies to the east of the center of the remnant, stretching from about one-fourth to three-fourths of the remnant's radius. It is wedge-shaped, with a steady opening angle from an apex on the eastern side. The feature resembles the disturbance expected from an object moving through the material supersonically at about 800 km/s. We present arguments suggesting that the linear feature might have been produced by a low-mass star or compact object ejected from a binary system which may have led to a Type Ic supernova.

1732884,"Using the StarTrack population synthesis code we analyze the formation channels possibly available to double neutron star binaries and find that they can be richer than previously thought. We identify a group of short lived, tight binaries, which do not live long enough to escape their host galaxies, despite their large center-of-mass velocities. We present our most recent results on all possible evolutionary paths leading to the formation of double neutron stars, calculate their coalescence rates, and also revisit the question of the distribution of merger sites around host galaxies. For a wide variety of binary evolution models and galaxy potentials, we find that most of neutron star mergers take place within galaxies. Our results stem from allowing for radial and common envelope evolution of helium-rich stars (testable in the future with detailed stellar-structure and hydrodynamic calculations) and indicate that double neutron star binaries may not be excluded as Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) progenitors solely on the basis of their spatial distribution around host galaxies. We also find, in contrast to Bethe & Brown (1998), that in a significant fraction of common envelope (CE) phases neutron stars do not accrete enough material to become black holes, and thus the channels involving CEs are still open for the formation of double neutron stars.

1732885,"We present a set of detailed molecular line maps of the region associated with the giant Herbig-Haro flow HH 315, from the young star PV Cephei, aimed at studying the outflow-cloud interaction. Our study clearly shows that the HH 315 flow is effecting the kinematics of its surrounding medium, and has been able to redistribute considerable amounts of the surrounding medium-density gas in its star-forming core as well at parsec-scale distances from the source. The giant molecular outflow HH 315 is a highly asymmetric bipolar flow with a projected linear extent of about 2 pc. Our results indicate that the two outflow lobes are each interacting with the ambient medium in different ways. The southern (redshifted) lobe interacts with a dense ambient medium, very close to the young stellar outflow source, and its kinetic energy is comparable to both the turbulent and gravitational binding energy of its host cloud. In addition, we find evidence that the southern lobe is responsible for the creation of a cavity in the 13CO emission. In contrast, the northern (mainly blueshifted) outflow lobe extends farther from PV Ceph and interacts with ambient gas much less dense than the southern lobe. There is very little 13CO emission north of the outflow source, and the only prominent 13CO emission is a shell-like structure coincident with the outer edge of the northern lobe, about 1.2 pc northwest of PV Ceph. It appears that the northern lobe of the HH 315 outflow has been able to ``push'' aside a substantial fraction of the gas in the area, piling it in a dense shell-like structure at its edges. In addition, we find that the northern outflow lobe is responsible for a velocity gradient in the ambient gas. Comment: 46 pages, including 13 figures and 2 tables.

1732886,"Although soft X-ray absorption features in AGN were discovered almost ten years ago, the nature and location of the gas creating them has remained controversial. However, by making use of the newly-available high-resolution spectra provided by XMM-Newton and Chandra, we should be able to make substantial advances. The first such spectra indicate that multiple ionization states coexist in the absorber; this is a natural consequence of photoionization physics. Photoionized evaporation in the presence of a copious mass source locks the ratio of ionizing intensity to pressure to a critical value. A broad range of temperatures can all coexist in equilibrium for this value of the ratio of ionizing intensity to pressure. Consequently, the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous in temperature. The inferred distance of this material from the source of ionizing radiation depends on how much matter exists at the highest-obtainable temperature. This distance can be measured by monitoring how ionic column densities respond to changes in the ionizing continuum on timescales of days to years."
1732887,"As recently suggested, nearby quasar remnants are plausible sites of black-hole based compact dynamos that could be capable of accelerating ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). In such a model, UHECRs would originate at the nuclei of nearby dead quasars, those in which the putative underlying supermassive black holes are suitably spun-up. Based on galactic optical luminosity, morphological type, and redshift, we have compiled a small sample of nearby objects selected to be highly luminous, bulge-dominated galaxies, likely quasar remnants. The sky coordinates of these galaxies were then correlated with the arrival directions of cosmic rays detected at energies >40 EeV. An apparently significant correlation appears in our data. This correlation appears at closer angular scales than those expected when taking into account the deflection caused by typically assumed IGM or galactic magnetic fields over a charged particle trajectory. Possible scenarios producing this effect are discussed, as is the astrophysics of the quasar remnant candidates. We suggest that quasar remnants be also taken into account in the forthcoming detailed search for correlations using data from the Auger Observatory."
1732888,"We analyze high signal-to-noise spectra for 14 globular clusters (GCs) in the Sombrero galaxy, NGC 4594 (= M104), obtained with the LRIS spectrograph on the Keck I telescope. We find generally good agreement between spectroscopic metallicities and previous photometric metallicities based on V-I colors. Further, we use measurements of various Balmer line indices on co-added spectra of metal-poor and metal-rich GCs to estimate ages for the GC subpopulations and find ages of 10–15 Gyr, with preferred ages around 11–12 Gyr and no detectable differences between the metal-rich and metal-poor subpopulations. However, because of model and measurement uncertainties, age differences of a few (2–3) gigayears cannot be ruled out. We also measure α-to-iron abundance ratios from Mg and TiO features and find enhancements on the order of [α/Fe] ~ +0.4, similar to the [α/Fe] abundance ratios observed in other old stellar populations. Finally, we combine our sample with radial velocities for 34 GCs from Bridges et al. and obtain virial and projected masses for the Sombrero of MVT = (8.1 ± 1.8) × 1011 M and MP = (5.3 ± 1.0) × 1011 M within 17 kpc, respectively.

But an extremal Groemer packing of n unit discs does not exist for all natural numbers n and in this case, the number n is called exceptional. We are interested in number theoretic characterizations of the exceptional numbers. A counterexample is given to a conjecture of Wegner concerning such a characterization. We further give a characterization of the exceptional numbers, whose shape is closely related to that of Wegner's conjecture."
1732900,"The Submillimetre Common User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) instrument has been operating on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) since 1997. The data archive is now sufficiently large that it can be used to investigate instrumental properties and the variability of astronomical sources. This paper describes the automated calibration and reduction scheme used to process the archive data, with particular emphasis on ‘jiggle-map’ observations of compact sources. We demonstrate the validity of our automated approach at both 850 and 450 μm, and apply it to several of the JCMT secondary flux calibrators. We determine light curves for the variable sources IRC +10216 and OH 231.8. This automation is made possible by using the orac-dr data reduction pipeline, a flexible and extensible data reduction pipeline that is used on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) and the JCMT."
1732901,"The two nearby starburst galaxies M 82 and NGC 253 were observed for ~ 100 ksec over a 10-month period in 1997. An increase of the M 82 flux by a factor ~ 2 was measured during the period July-November, when compared with the flux measured earlier in 1997. The flux measured in the field centered on M 82 includes ~ 38% of the emission from the Seyfert 1 galaxy M 81. The best-fitting model for the earlier emission from M 82 is thermal with kT =~ 6.7 +/- 0.1. In the high flux state, the emission additionally includes either an absorbed second thermal component or absorbed power-law component, with the former providing a much better fit. A likely origin for the temporal variability is a single source in M 82. The flux of NGC 253, which did not vary significantly during the period of observations, can be well fit by either a thermal spectrum with kT =~ 3.8 +/- 0.3 keV, or by a power law with photon index of 2.7 +/- 0.10. We have also attempted fitting the measurements to more realistic composite models with thermal and power-law components, such as would be expected from a dominant contribution from binary systems, or Compton scattering of (far) IR radiation by radio emitting electrons. However, the addition of any amount of a power-law component, even with cutoff at 20 keV, only increases chi-square. The 90% confidence upper limit for power law emission with (photon) index 1.5 is only 2.4% of the 2-10 keV flux of M 82; the corresponding limit for NGC 253, with index 2.0, is 48%."
1732902,"We present the results of a J, H, and K_s photometric monitoring campaign of a 0.72 x 6 sq deg. area centered on the Chamaeleon I star forming region. Data were obtained on 15 separate nights over a 4 month time interval using the 2MASS South telescope. Out of a total of 34,539 sources brighter than the photometric completeness limits (J=16.0, H=15.2, K_s=14.8), 95 exhibit near-infrared variability in one or more bands. The variables can be grouped into a population of bright, red objects that are associated with the Chamaeleon I association, and a population of faint, blue variables that are dispersed over the full 6 deg of the survey and are likely field stars or older pre-main-sequence stars unrelated to the present-day Chamaeleon I molecular cloud. Ten new candidate members of Chamaeleon I, including 8 brown dwarf candidates, have been identified based on variability and/or near-infrared excess emission in the J-H vs. H-K_s color-color-diagram. We also provide a compendium of astrometry and J, H, and K_s photometry for previously identified members and candidate members of Chamaeleon I.

1732903,"Traditionally, a simulation of a dense stellar system required choosing an initial model, running an integrator, and analyzing the output. Almost all of the effort went into writing a clever integrator that could handle binaries, triples and encounters between various multiple systems efficiently. Recently, the scope and complexity of these simulations has increased dramatically, for three reasons: 1) the sheer size of the data sets, measured in Terabytes, make traditional `awking and grepping' of a single output file impractical; 2) the addition of stellar evolution data brings qualitatively new challenges to the data reduction; 3) increased realism of the simulations invites realistic forms of `SOS': Simulations of Observations of Simulations, to be compared directly with observations. We are now witnessing a shift toward the construction of archives as well as tailored forms of visualization including the use of virtual reality simulators and planetarium domes, and a coupling of both with budding efforts in constructing virtual observatories. This review describes these new trends, presenting Starlab as the first example of a full software environment for realistic large-scale simulations of dense stellar systems."
1732904,"The giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2, located near the Galactic Centre, has been observed in the far-infrared by the ISO Long Wavelength Spectrometer. Wavelengths in the range 47-196 microns were covered with the high resolution Fabry-Perot spectrometer, giving a spectral resolution of 30-40 km/s. The J=1-0 and J=2-1 rotational transitions of HD fall within this range at 112 microns and 56 microns. A probable detection was made of the ground state J=1-0 line in emission but the J=2-1 line was not detected above the noise. This allowed us to calculate an upper limit on the temperature in the emitting region of approximately 80 K and a value for the deuterium abundance in the Sgr B2 envelope of D/H=(0.2-11)x10^-6.

1732905,"SLX 1737-282 is a persistent moderately bright X-ray source 1.2 deg from the Galactic center. X-ray observations with the Wide Field Cameras on BeppoSAX have for the first time revealed the true nature of SLX 1737-282: a 15-min long thermonuclear flash was detected exposing the source as a neutron star in a binary system. The flash was Eddington-limited constraining the distance to between 5 and 8 kpc. We analyze BeppoSAX, ROSAT, and RXTE data on SLX 1737-282. The persistent 0.5-200 keV luminosity is close to or less than 1% of the Eddington limit which implies a rarely-seen circumstance for thermonuclear flash activity.

1732906,"We present a new set of high-resolution molecular line maps of the gas immediately surrounding various Herbig-Haro (HH) knots of the giant HH flow HH 315, from the young star PV Cephei. The observations, aimed at studying the entrainment mechanism of the 2.6 pc-long HH 315 flow, include IRAM 30m maps of the 12CO(2-1), 12CO(1-0), and 13CO(1-0) lines, with beam sizes of 11'', 21'', and 22'', respectively. We compare the morphology and the kinematics of the outflow gas, as well as the temperature and momentum distribution of the molecular outflow with those predicted by different entrainment models. With our detailed study we are able to conclude that jet bow shock entrainment by an episodic stellar wind, with a time-varying axis, produces most of the high-velocity molecular outflow observed far from the source. In addition, near PV Cephei we find evidence for a poorly collimated, wide-angle, molecular outflow and a collimated wiggling jet-like molecular outflow. We propose that the poorly collimated component is entrained by a wide-angle wind, and the collimated component is entrained by a variable jet with internal working surfaces. If this picture is true, then a stellar wind model which allows for the coexistence of a wide-angle component and a collimated (jet-like) stellar wind component is needed to explain the observed properties of the PV Ceph outflow. The wiggling axis of the redshifted molecular outflow lobe indicates that the outflow ejection axis is changing over time. We find that the time-scale of the axis variation shown by the molecular outflow lobe is about a factor of 10 less than that shown by the large-scale optical HH knots.

1732907,"Although inner star-forming rings are common in optical images of barred spiral galaxies, observational evidence for the accompanying molecular gas has been scarce. In this paper we present images of molecular inner rings, traced using the CO (1-0) emission line, from the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland-Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies (BIMA SONG). We detect inner-ring CO emission from all five SONG barred galaxies classified as inner ring [type (r)]. We also examine the seven SONG barred galaxies classified as inner spiral [type (s)]; in one of these, NGC 3627, we find morphological and kinematic evidence for a molecular inner ring. Inner-ring galaxies have been classified as such based on optical images, which emphasize recent star formation. We consider the possibility that there may exist inner rings in which star formation efficiency is not enhanced. However, we find that in NGC 3627 the inner-ring star formation efficiency is enhanced relative to most other regions in that galaxy. We note that the SONG (r) galaxies have a paucity of CO and Hα emission interior to the inner ring (except near the nucleus), while NGC 3627 has relatively bright bar CO and Hα emission; we suggest that galaxies with inner rings such as NGC 3627 may be misclassified if there are significant amounts of gas and star formation in the bar."
1732908,"A prototype cross-dispersed optical echelle spectrograph of very high resolution has been designed and built at Steward Observatory and tested at the Starfire Optical Range (SOR) 1.5 m telescope. It is the first spectrograph to take advantage of diffraction-limited images provided by adaptive optics in order to achieve a potential resolving power of $R \sim 600,000$. The wavelength coverage in a single exposure is about 300 \AA, which is approximately 100 times that of conventional spectrographs operating at comparable resolution. This was achieved by recording 60 cross-dispersed orders across the $18\times 18$ mm$^2$ area of the CCD detector. The total efficiency of the system, including the sky and telescope transmission, spectrograph and CCD detector, is measured to be 1.3% at peak, much higher than that of other ultra-high-resolution spectrographs.

With a second year of data, we have now limited both Q and U on a ring of 1° radius. The window functions are broad: for E-mode polarization, the effective l is 〈lE〉 = 191 -132+143. We find that the E-mode signal can be no greater than 8.4 μK (95% CL), assuming no 5-mode polarization. Limits on a possible 5-mode signal are also presented."
1732910,"We consider the shock structures that can arise in blazar jets as a consequence of variations in the jet flow velocity. There are two possible cases: (1) A double shock system consisting of both a forward and reverse shock (2) A single shock (either forward or reverse) together with a rarefaction wave. These possibilities depend upon the relative velocity of the two different sections of jet. Using previously calculated spherical models for estimates of the magnetic field and electron number density of the emission region in the TeV blazar Markarian 501, we show that this region is in the form of a thin disk, in the plasma rest frame. It is possible to reconcile spectral and pair opacity constraints for MKN 501 for Doppler factors in the range of 10--20. This is easiest if the corrections for TeV absorption by the infrared background are not as large as implied by recent models.

1732911,"We present new HST/WFPC2 (V,I) photometry for the red-giant stars in NGC 5128 at a projected distance of 8 kpc from the galaxy center, which probe a mixture of its inner halo and outer bulge. The color-magnitude diagram shows an old red-giant branch which is even broader in color than our two previously studied outer-halo fields (at 21 and 31 kpc), with significant numbers of stars extending to Solar metallicity and higher. The peak frequency of the metallicity distribution function (MDF) is at [m/H] ~ -0.4, with even fewer metal-poor stars than in the outer-halo fields. We find that the main features of the halo MDF can be reproduced by a simple chemical evolution model in which early star formation goes on simultaneously with an initial stage of rapid infall of very metal-poor gas, after which the infall dies away exponentially. A comparison with the MDF for the NGC 5128 globular clusters indicates that there is a clear decrease of specific frequency $S_N$ (number of clusters per unit halo light) with increasing metallicity, from S_N ~ 4-8 at [Fe/H] < -1.6 down to S_N = 1.5 at [Fe/H] > -1. This trend may indicate that globular cluster formation efficiency is a strong function of the metallicity of the protocluster gas.

1732912,"The existence of density-bounded HII regions in spiral galaxies is supported by means of a spectral indicator based on the intensity of the [OI]6300A forbidden line. A grid of photoionization models providing spectral information of density-bounded nebulae is presented in order to test the validity of our indicator. The indicator is applicable to typical observed HII regions with solar or higher metallicities, and for the range of ages observed in normal HII regions. When applying the diagnostic to a large sample of HII regions of spiral galaxies taken from the literature, we find that a fraction of the selected HII regions with emission detected in the [OI]6300A line turn out to be consistent with the predictions of density-bounded photoionization models. Preliminary estimates of the fraction of Lyman continuum photons escaping ranges from 20% to 40%. The number of density-bounded HII regions could be even larger after confirmation of those regions for which the [OI] line was not detected, provided they are good density-bounded candidates. We stress the importance of having combined information on both good measurements or reliable upper limits for the intensity of this line, and good determinations of the Halpha luminosity for complete samples of HII regions in galaxies in order to make proper estimations as to whether UV photons escaping from HII regions are the main source of ionization of the diffuse ionized medium in galaxies.

1732913,"We report the discovery of variable circularly polarized radio emission associated with relativistic ejections from GRS 1915 + 105, based on observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN). Following a radio flare in 2001 January, significant and variable circular polarization, at a fractional level of 0.2–0.4 per cent, was measured with ATCA at four frequencies between 1 and 9 GHz. Following an additional outburst 65 d later in 2001 March, further ATCA observations measured a comparable sign and level of circular polarization at two frequencies. At this second epoch, contemporaneous MERLIN observations directly imaged a relativistic ejection event and allowed us confidently to associate both the circularly and the linearly polarized emission with the relativistic ejecta, allowing a detailed measurement of the full polarization properties in the optically thin phase. The fractional circular polarization spectrum appears to flatten at higher frequencies in 2001 January, when there is strong evidence for multiple components at different optical depths. While we cannot conclusively distinguish between synchrotron or propagation-induced conversion as the origin of the circularly polarized component, we do not consider that coherent or birefringent scintillation mechanisms are likely. The implication is therefore that the ejections from GRS 1915 + 105 are associated with a significant population of low-energy electrons, with associated consequences for the energetics of relativistic ejection events. We briefly compare the data for SS 433 and GRS 1915 + 105 with those for active galactic nuclei, and note that linear-to-circular polarization ratios <1 are observed in both binary sources at the lowest frequency, and ratios >1 at the higher frequencies, illustrating the role of Faraday depolarization. In addition, the 2001 January ATCA observations reveal a linear polarization ‘rotator’ event, probing the (variable) orientation of the magnetic field structure in the outflow."
1732914,"The effect of the expansion of powerful FR-II radio sources into a cluster environment is discussed. The analysis considers both the thermal and temporal evolution of the ICM which has passed through the bow shock of the radio source and the effect of this swept-up gas on the dynamics of the radio source itself. The final state of the swept-up ICM is critcally dependent on the thermal conductivity of the gas. If the gas behind the bow shock expands adiabatically, and the source is expanding into a steeply falling atmosphere, then a narrow dense layer will form as the radio source lifts gas out of the cluster potential. This layer has a cooling time very much less than that of the gas just ahead of the radio source. This effect does not occur if the thermal conductivity of the gas is high, or if the cluster atmosphere is shallow. The swept-up gas also affects the dyamics of the radio source especially as it slows towards sub-sonic expansion. The preferential accumulation of the swept-up gas to the sides of the cocoon leads to the aspect ratio of the source increasing. Eventually the contact surface must become Rayleigh-Taylor unstable leading both to inflow of the swept-up ICM into the cavity created by the cocoon, but also substantial mixing of the cooler denser swept-up gas with the ambient ICM thereby creating a multi-phase ICM. The radio source is likely to have a marked effect on the cluster on timescales long compared to the age of the source. Comment: 12 pages, 3 figures"
1732915,"The calibration of ground-based submillimetre observations has always been a difficult process. We discuss how to overcome the limitations imposed by the submillimetre atmosphere. Novel ways to improve line-of-sight opacity estimates are presented, resulting in tight relations between opacities at different wavelengths. The submillimetre camera SCUBA, mounted on the JCMT, is the first large-scale submillimetre array, and as such is ideal for combatting the effects of the atmosphere. For example, we find that the off-source pixels are crucial for removing sky-noise. Benefitting from several years of SCUBA operation, a database of deep SCUBA observations has been constructed to better understand the nature of sky-noise and the effects of the atmosphere on instrument sensitivity. This has revealed several results. Firstly, there is evidence for positive correlations between sky-noise and seeing and sky-noise and sky opacity. Furthermore, 850-micron and 450-micron sky-noise are clearly correlated, suggesting that 450-micron data may be used to correct 850-micron observations for sky-noise. Perhaps most important of all: if off-source bolometers are used for sky-noise removal, there is no correlation between instrument sensitivity and chop throw, for chop throws out to 180 arcsec. Understanding the effects of submillimetre seeing is also important, and we find that the JCMT beam is not significantly broadened by seeing, nor is there an obvious correlation between seeing and pointing excursions.

1732916,"PSR J1806-2125 is a pulsar discovered in the Parkes multibeam pulsar survey with a rotational period of 0.4s and a characteristic age of 65kyr. Between MJDs 51462 and 51894 this pulsar underwent an increase in rotational frequency of $\Delta \nu/\nu \approx 16 \times 10^{-6}$. The magnitude of this glitch is approximately 2.5 times greater than any previously observed in any pulsar and 16 times greater than the mean glitch size. This letter gives the parameters of the glitch and compares its properties to previously observed events. The existence of such large and rare glitches offers new hope for attempts to observe thermal X-ray emission from the internal heat released following a glitch, and suggests that pulsars which previously have not been observed to glitch may do so on long timescales.

1732918,"We present in this paper high signal-to-noise long-slit optical spectra of the Extended Red Emission (ERE) in the ``Red Rectangle'' (RR) nebula. These spectra, obtained at different positions in the nebula, reveal an extremely complex emission pattern on top of the broad ERE continuum. It is well known that three features converge at large distance from the central object, in wavelength and profile to the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) at lam 5797, lam 5849.8 and and lam 6614 Å(e.g. Sarre et al. \cite{Sar95}). In this paper we give a detailed inventory of all spectral subfeatures observed in the 5550-6850 Åspectral range. Thanks to our high S/N spectra, we propose 5 new features in the RR that can be associated with DIBs. For the 5550-6200 Åspectral range our slit position was on top of the NE spike of the X shaped nebula. A detailed description of the spatial profile-changes is given of the strongest features revealing that even far out in the nebula at 24 arcsec from the central star, there remains a small shift in wavelength of 1 respectively 2 Åbetween the ERE subfeatures and the DIB wavelengths of lam 5797.11 and lam 5849.78 Å.

1732919,"The Caltech Submillimeter Observatory has detected triply deuterated ammonia, ND3, through its JK=10a ->00s transition near 310 GHz. Emission is found in the NGC 1333 region, both towards IRAS 4A and a position to the South-East where DCO+ peaks. In both cases, the hyperfine ratio indicates that the emission is optically thin. Column densities of ND3 are 3-6x 1011 cm-2 for Tex,= 10 K and twice as high for Tex,= 5 K. Using a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code and a model of the structure of the IRAS source with temperature and density gradients, the estimated ND3 abundance is 3.2x 10-12 if ND3/H2 is constant throughout the envelope. In the more likely case that ND3/H2D+ is constant, ND3/H2 peaks in the cold outer parts of the source at a value of 1.0x 10-11. To reproduce the observed NH3/ND3 abundance ratio of ~ 1000, grain surface chemistry requires an atomic D/H ratio of ~0.15 in the gas phase, >10 times higher than in recent chemical models. More likely, the deuteration of NH3 occurs by ion-molecule reactions in the gas phase, in which case the data indicate that deuteron transfer reactions are much faster than proton transfers."
1732922,"We assess the principal statistical and physical uncertainties associated with the determination of magnetic field strengths in clusters of galaxies from measurements of Faraday rotation (FR) and Compton-synchrotron emissions. In the former case a basic limitation is noted, that the relative uncertainty in the estimation of the mean-squared FR will generally be at least one third. Even greater uncertainty stems from the crucial dependence of the Faraday-deduced field on the coherence length scale characterizing its random orientation; we further elaborate this dependence, and argue that previous estimates of the field are likely to be too high by a factor of a few. Lack of detailed spatial information on the radio emission--and the recently deduced nonthermal X-ray emission in four clusters--has led to an underestimation of the mean value of the field in cluster cores. We conclude therefore that it is premature to draw definite quantitative conclusions from the previously-claimed seemingly-discrepant values of the field determined by these two methods.

1732923,"We explain in simple terms how the buildup of dark haloes by merging compact satellites, as in the CDM cosmology, inevitably leads to an inner cusp of density profile $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \gsim 1$, as seen in cosmological N-body simulations. A flatter halo core with $\alpha <1$ exerts on the satellites tidal compression in all directions, which prevents deposit of stripped satellite material in the core region. This makes the satellite orbits decay from the radius where $\alpha \sim 1$ to the halo centre with no local tidal mass transfer and thus causes a rapid steepening of the inner profile to $\alpha >1$. These tidal effects, the resultant steepening of the profile to a cusp, and the stability of this cusp to tandem mergers with compact satellites, are demonstrated using N-body simulations. The transition at $\alpha \sim 1$ is then addressed using toy models in the limiting cases of impulse and adiabatic approximations and using tidal radii for satellites on radial and circular orbits. In an associated paper we address the subsequent slow convergence from either side to an asymptotic stable cusp with $\alpha \gsim 1$. Our analysis thus implies that an inner cusp is enforced when small haloes are typically more compact than larger haloes, as in the CDM scenario, such that enough satellite material makes it intact into the inner halo and is deposited there. We conclude that a necessary condition for maintaining a flat core, as indicated by observations, is that the inner regions of the CDM satellite haloes be puffed up by about 50% such that when they merge into a bigger halo they would be disrupted outside the halo core. This puffing up could be due to baryonic feedback processes in small haloes, which may be stimulated by the tidal compression in the halo cores."

A significant enhancement in the mass-loss rate may be expected in this case, due to the formation of cool magnetic spots.

1732928,"Using large number of Rossi X-ray Time Explorer observations of Sco X-1 we present a detailed investigation of the transition layer (TL) and the relativistic precession (RP) models. These models predict the existence of the invariant quantities: an inclination angle delta of the magnetospheric axis with the normal to the disk for the TLM and a neutron star (NS) mass M_{NS} for the RPM. Theoretical predictions of both models are tested and their self-consistency is checked. We establish that: (1) The inferred delta angle is 5.56+/-0.09 degrees. Correlation of the delta-values with the horizontal branch oscillation (HBO) frequency is rather weak. (2) There is a strong correlation between an inferred M_{NS} and the HBO frequency in the RPM frameworks. (3) We infer M_{NS} for different assumptions regarding the relations between the HBO frequency and the nodal frequency. We find that the inferred M_{NS}=2.7+/-0.1 M_sun cannot be consistent with any EOS of NS matter. We conclude that RPM fails to describe the data while TLM seems to be compatible.

1732929,"ABSTRACTA Bayesian approach is presented for detecting and characterizing the signal from discrete objects embedded in a diffuse background. The approach centres around the evaluation of the posterior distribution for the parameters of the discrete objects, given the observed data, and defines the theoretically optimal procedure for parametrized object detection. Two alternative strategies are investigated: the simultaneous detection of all the discrete objects in the data set, and the iterative detection of objects. In both cases, the parameter space characterizing the object(s) is explored using Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling. For the iterative detection of objects, another approach is to locate the global maximum of the posterior at each iteration using a simulated annealing downhill simplex algorithm. The techniques are applied to a two-dimensional toy problem consisting of Gaussian objects embedded in uncorrelated pixel noise. A cosmological illustration of the iterative approach is also presented, in which the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effects from clusters of galaxies are detected in microwave maps dominated by emission from primordial cosmic microwave background anisotropies."
1732930,"We implement and further refine the recently proposed method at Kashlinsky et al. (\cite{Kas01}) (KHA) for a time efficient extraction of the power spectrum from future cosmic microwave background (CMB) maps. The method is based on the clustering properties of peaks and troughs of the Gaussian CMB sky. The procedure takes only (1)/(2)[f(ν)]2N2 steps where f(ν) is the fraction of pixels with |δ T|≥ν standard deviations in the map of N pixels. We use the new statistic introduced in KHA, ξν, which characterizes spatial clustering of the CMB sky peaks of progressively increasing thresholds. The tiny fraction of the remaining pixels (peaks and troughs) contains the required information on the CMB power spectrum of the entire map. The threshold ν is the only parameter that determines the accuracy of the final spectrum. We performed detailed numerical simulations for parameters of the two-year WMAP and Planck CMB sky data including cosmological signal, inhomogeneous noise and foreground residuals. In all cases we find that the method can recover the power spectrum out to the Nyquist scale of the experiment channel. We discuss how the error bars scale with ν allowing to decide between accuracy and speed. The method can determine with significant accuracy the CMB power spectrum from the upcoming CMB maps in only ˜(10-5-10-3)× N2 operations."
1732931,"We present a study of inhomogeneous big bang nucleosynthesis with emphasis on transport phenomena. We combine a hydrodynamic treatment to a nuclear reaction network and compute the light element abundances for a range of inhomogeneity parameters. We find that shortly after annihilation of electron-positron pairs, Thomson scattering on background photons prevents the diffusion of the remaining electrons. Protons and multiply charged ions then tend to diffuse into opposite directions so that no net charge is carried. Ions with Z>1 get enriched in the overdense regions, while protons diffuse out into regions of lower density. This leads to a second burst of nucleosynthesis in the overdense regions at T<20 keV, leading to enhanched destruction of deuterium and lithium. We find a region in the parameter space at 2.1E-10<eta<5.2E-10 where constraints 7Li/H<10^{-9.7} and D/H<10^{-4.4} are satisfied simultaneously.

1732932,"In popular cold dark matter cosmological scenarios, stars may have first appeared in significant numbers around a redshift of 10 or so, as the gas within protogalactic halos with virial temperatures in excess of 20,000 K (corresponding to masses comparable to those of present--day dwarf ellipticals) cooled rapidly due to atomic processes and fragmented. It is this `second generation' of subgalactic stellar systems, aided perhaps by an early population of accreting black holes in their nuclei, which may have generated the ultraviolet radiation and mechanical energy that ended the cosmic ``dark ages'' and reheated and reionized most of the hydrogen in the cosmos by a redshift of 6. The detailed history of the universe during and soon after these crucial formative stages depends on the power--spectrum of density fluctuations on small scales and on a complex network of poorly understood `feedback' mechanisms, and is one of the missing link in galaxy formation and evolution studies. The astrophysics of the epoch of first light is recorded in the thermal state, ionization degree, and chemical composition of the intergalactic medium, the main repository of baryons at high redshifts."
1732933,"The full moduli space of a class of = 1 supersymmetric gauge theories is studied. For gauge theories living on a stack of D3-branes at Calabi-Yau singularities , is a combination of the mesonic and baryonic branches. In consonance with the mathematical literature, the single brane moduli space is called the master space . Illustrating with a host of explicit examples, we exhibit many algebro-geometric properties of the master space such as when is toric Calabi-Yau, behaviour of its Hilbert series, its irreducible components and its symmetries. In conjunction with the plethystic programme, we investigate the counting of BPS gauge invariants, baryonic and mesonic, using the geometry of and show how its refined Hilbert series not only engenders the generating functions for the counting but also beautifully encode ``hidden'' global symmetries of the gauge theory which manifest themselves as symmetries of the complete moduli space for N number of branes."
1732934,"We use a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation of a cold dark matter universe to investigate theoretically the relationship between high-redshift galaxies and the Lyα forest at redshift z = 3. Galaxies in the simulation are surrounded by halos of hot gas, which nevertheless contain enough neutral hydrogen to cause a Lyα flux decrement, its strength increasing with galaxy mass. A comparison with recent observational data by Adelberger et al. on the Lyα forest around galaxies reveals that actual galaxies may have systematically less Lyα absorption within 1 Mpc of them than our simulated galaxies. In order to investigate this possibility, we add several simple prescriptions for galaxy feedback on the intergalactic medium (IGM) to the evolved simulation. These include the effect of photoionizing background radiation coming from galactic sources, galactic winds whose only effect is to deposit thermal energy into the IGM, and another, kinetic model for winds, which are assumed to evacuate cavities in the IGM around galaxies. We find that only the latter is able to produce a large effect, enough to match the tentative observational data, given the energy available from star formation in the simulated galaxies. Another intriguing possibility is that a selection effect is responsible, so that galaxies with low Lyα absorption are preferentially included in the sample. This is also viable but predicts galaxy properties (including clustering) that are very different from the other scenarios."
1732935,"We have obtained Keck HIRES spectra of three images of the gravitationally lensed QSO 2237+0305 to study low ionization absorption systems and their differences in terms of projected velocity and column density across the lines of sight. We detect CaII absorption from our Galaxy, and a system of High Velocity Clouds from the lensing galaxy (z=0.039). CaII components with total equivalent widths similar to those of Galactic intermediate and high velocity clouds are spread out over several hundred km/s at impact parameters of less than one kpc from the center of the lensing galaxy. We have also studied three low ionization MgII-FeII systems in detail. All three systems cover all three lines of sight, suggesting that the gaseous structures giving rise to MgII complexes are larger than about 0.5 kpc. However, in most cases it is difficult to trace individual MgII `cloudlets' over distances larger than 200-300 pc, indicating that typical sizes of the MgII cloudlets are smaller than the sizes inferred earlier for the individual CIV high ionization gas clouds. We tentatively interpret the absorption pattern of the strongest MgII system in terms of an expanding bubble or galactic wind and show that the possible loci occupied by the model bubble in radius-velocity space overlap with the observed characteristics of Galactic supershells.

1732936,"We observed 17 optically selected, radio-quiet, high-redshift quasars with the Chandra ACIS and detected 16 of them. The quasars have redshifts between 3.70 and 6.28 and include the highest-redshift quasars known. When compared with low-redshift quasars observed with ROSAT, these high-redshift quasars are significantly more X-ray-quiet. We also find that the X-ray spectral index of the high-redshift objects is flatter than the average at lower redshift. These trends confirm the predictions of models in which the accretion flow is described by a cold, optically thick accretion disk surrounded by a hot, optically thin corona, provided the viscosity parameter α ≥ 0.02. The high-redshift quasars have supermassive black holes, with masses of ~1010 M☉, and are accreting material at ~0.1 times the Eddington limit. We detect 10 X-ray photons from the z = 6.28 quasar SDSS 1030+0524, which might have a Gunn-Peterson trough and be near the redshift of reionization of the intergalactic medium. The X-ray data place an upper limit on the optical depth of the intergalactic medium, τ(IGM) < 106, compared to the lower limit from the spectrum of Lyα and Lyβ, which implies τ(IGM) > 20."
1732937,"An important aspect of astrophysical MHD turbulence research is developing diagnostics to connect simulations with the observable universe. Turbulent systems are by definition structurally complex in all fluid variables (density, velocity, and magnetic field), such that they must be described statistically. By developing and applying diagnostic tools to simulation data, it is possible to interpret empirical laws for the statistical properties of observed systems in terms of fundamental dynamical processes, and to identify and calibrate robust probes of physical parameters that cannot be measured directly. Using several different examples, I describe how structural diagnostic analyses have already yielded significant insights into the nature of turbulent molecular clouds. I review results from several different groups, and discuss directions for future diagnostics to enhance our understanding of cloud structure and constrain models of the evolutionary course that governs star formation."
1732938,"We present a sample of 46 galaxy nuclei from 12 nearby (z<4500 km/s) Hickson Compact Groups (HCGs) with a complete suite of 1-24 micron 2MASS+Spitzer nuclear photometry. For all objects in the sample, blue emission from stellar photospheres dominates in the near-IR through the 3.6 micron IRAC band. Twenty-five of 46 (54%) galaxy nuclei show red, mid-IR continua characteristic of hot dust powered by ongoing star formation and/or accretion onto a central black hole. We introduce alpha_{IRAC}, the spectral index of a power-law fit to the 4.5-8.0 micron IRAC data, and demonstrate that it cleanly separates the mid-IR active and non-active HCG nuclei. This parameter is more powerful for identifying low to moderate-luminosity mid-IR activity than other measures which include data at rest-frame lambda<3.6 micron that may be dominated by stellar photospheric emission. While the HCG galaxies clearly have a bimodal distribution in this parameter space, a comparison sample from the Spitzer Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS) matched in J-band total galaxy luminosity is continuously distributed. A second diagnostic, the fraction of 24 micron emission in excess of that expected from quiescent galaxies, f_{24D}, reveals an additional 3 nuclei to be active at 24 micron. Comparing these two mid-IR diagnostics of nuclear activity to optical spectroscopic identifications from the literature reveals some discrepancies, and we discuss the challenges of distinguishing the source of ionizing radiation in these and other lower luminosity systems. We find a significant correlation between the fraction of mid-IR active galaxies and the total HI mass in a group, and investigate possible interpretations of these results in light of galaxy evolution in the highly interactive system of a compact group environment.

1732940,"Natural numbers divisible by the same prime factor lie on defined spiral graphs which are running through the Square Root Spiral (also named as the Spiral of Theodorus or Wurzel Spirale or Einstein Spiral). Prime Numbers also clearly accumulate on such spiral graphs. And the square numbers 4, 9, 16, 25, 36,... form a highly three-symmetrical system of three spiral graphs, which divides the square-root-spiral into three equal areas. A mathematical analysis shows that these spiral graphs are defined by quadratic polynomials. Fibonacci number sequences also play a part in the structure of the Square Root Spiral. Fibonacci Numbers divide the Square Root Spiral into areas and angle sectors with constant proportions. These proportions are linked to the golden mean (or golden section), which behaves as a self-avoiding-walk-constant in the lattice-like structure of the square root spiral."
1732941,Radiations produced by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation at the Z0 pole can be used to heat up the primary stage of a thermonuclear warhead and can in principle detonate the device remotely. Neutrino-antineutrino annihilation can also be used as a tactical assault weapon to target hideouts that are unreachable by conventional means.
1732942,"We report the temperature dependent x-ray powder diffraction of the quaternary compound NdOFeAs (also called NdFeAsO) in the range between 300 and 95 K. We have detected the structural phase transition from the tetragonal phase, with P4/nmm space group, to the orthorhombic or monoclinic phase, with Cmma or P 112/n (or P 2/c) space group, over a broad temperature range from 150 to 120 K, centered at T0~137 K. Therefore the temperature of this structural phase transition is strongly reduced, by about ~30 K, by increasing the internal chemical pressure going from LaOFeAs to NdOFeAs. In contrast, the superconducting critical temperature increases from 27 to 51 K going from LaOFeAs to NdOFeAs doped samples. This result shows that the normal striped orthorhombic Cmma phase competes with the superconducting tetragonal phase. Therefore by controlling the internal chemical pressure in new materials it should be possible to push toward zero the critical temperature T0 of the structural phase transition, giving the striped phase, in order to get superconductors with higher Tc."
1732943,"We show that the application of the pinch technique to the conventional Schwinger-Dyson equations for the gluon propagator, gluon-quark vertex, and three-gluon vertex, gives rise to new equations endowed with special properties. The new series coincides with the one obtained in the Feynman gauge of the background field method, thus capturing the extensive gauge cancellations implemented by the pinch technique at the level of individual Green's functions. Its building blocks are the fully dressed pinch technique Green's functions obeying Abelian all-order Ward identities instead of the Slavnov-Taylor identites satisfied by their conventional counterparts. As a result, and contrary to the standard case, the new series can be truncated gauge invariantly at any order in the dressed loop expansion. The construction is streamlined by resorting to the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism which allows for a concise treatment of all the quantities appearing in the intermediate steps. The theoretical and phenomenological implications of this novel non-perturbative framework are discussed in detail."
1732944,"In the preceding chapter, the effects of lensing were so strong as to leave an unmistakable imprint on a specific source, allowing a detailed treatment. However, only the densest regions of the universe are able to provide such a spectacular lensing effect. To study more representative regions of the universe, we must examine large numbers of sources statistically. This is the domain of weak lensing."
1732945,"Spider is a long-duration, balloon-borne polarimeter designed to measure large-scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization with very high sensitivity and control of systematics. The instrument will map over half the sky with degree angular resolution in the I, Q, and U Stokes parameters in four frequency bands from 96 to 275 GHz. Spider's ultimate goal is to detect the primordial gravity-wave signal imprinted on the CMB B-mode polarization. One of the challenges in achieving this goal is the minimization of the contamination of B-modes by systematic effects. This paper explores a number of instrument systematics and observing strategies in order to optimize B-mode sensitivity. This is done by injecting realistic-amplitude, time-varying systematics into a set of simulated time streams. Tests of the impact of detector noise characteristics, pointing jitter, payload pendulations, polarization angle offsets, beam systematics, and receiver gain drifts are shown. Spider's default observing strategy is to spin continuously in azimuth, with polarization modulation achieved by either a rapidly spinning half-wave plate or a rapidly spinning gondola and a slowly stepped half-wave plate. Although the latter is more susceptible to systematics, the results shown here indicate that either mode of operation can be used by Spider."
1732946,"We show that it is possible to accommodate the observed size of the phase in $B^0_s$--$\bar B^0_s$, mixing in the framework of a model with violation of $3\times 3$ unitarity. This violation is associated to the presence of a new $Q=2/3$ isosinglet quark $T$, which mixes both with $t$ and $c$ and has a mass not exceeding 500 GeV. The crucial point is the fact that this framework allows for $\chi\equiv\arg(-V_{ts}V_{cb}V_{tb}^*V_{cs}^*)$ of order $\lambda$, to be contrasted with the situation in the Standard Model, where $\chi$ is constrained to be of order $\lambda^2$. We point out that this scenario implies rare top decays $t\to cZ$ at a rate observable at the LHC and $|V_{tb}|$ significantly different from unity. In this framework, one may also account for the observed size of $D^0$--$\bar D^0$ mixing without having to invoke long distance contributions. It is also shown that in the present scenario, the observed size of $D^0$--$\bar D^0$ mixing constrains $\chi^\prime\equiv\arg(-V_{cd}V_{us}V_{cs}^*V_{ud}^*)$ to be of order $\lambda^4$, which is significantly smaller than what is allowed in generic models with violations of $3\times 3$ unitarity."
1732947,"We include feedback in global hydrodynamic simulations in order to study the star formation properties, and gas structure and dynamics, in models of galactic disks. We extend previous models by implementing feedback in gravitationally bound clouds: momentum is injected at a rate proportional to the star formation rate. This mechanical energy disperses cloud gas back into the surrounding ISM, truncating star formation in a given cloud, and raising the overall level of ambient turbulence. Propagating star formation can however occur as expanding shells collide, enhancing the density and triggering new cloud and star formation. By controlling the momentum injection per massive star and the specific star formation rate in dense gas, we find that the negative effects of high turbulence outweigh the positive ones, and in net feedback reduces the fraction of dense gas and thus the overall star formation rate. The properties of the large clouds that form are not, however, very sensitive to feedback, with cutoff masses of a few million solar masses, similar to observations. We find a relationship between the star formation rate surface density and the gas surface density with a power law index ~2 for our models with the largest dynamic range, consistent with theoretical expectations for our model of disk flaring. We point out that the value of the ""Kennicutt-Schmidt"" index depends on the thickness of the disk. With our simple feedback prescription (a single combined star formation event per cloud), we find that global spiral patterns are not sustained; less correlated feedback and smaller scale turbulence appear to be necessary for spiral patterns to persist.

1732948,"In this paper, we proved that, for a semi-stable fibration of a proper smooth surface to a proper smooth curve over a filed of positive characteristic, if the p-rank of the generic fiber is 0, then the base change of the fibration by a sufficiently many iterative Frobenius morphism of the base curve violates the semi-positivity theorem. As an application, we suggest a statement on a distribution of p-ranks of reductions for a certain non-closed point in the moduli space over a number field."
1732949,"We investigate the anisotropy of magnetic reversal and current-driven domain wall motion in annealed Ga_0.95Mn_0.05As thin films and Hall bar devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Hall bars with current direction along the [110] and [1-10] crystallographic axes are studied. The [110] device shows larger coercive field than the [1-10] device. Strong anisotropy is observed during magnetic reversal between [110] and [1-10] directions. A power law dependence is found for both devices between the critical current (JC) and the magnetization (M), with J_C is proportional to M^2.6. The domain wall motion is strongly influenced by the presence of local pinning centres."
1732950,"Molecular dynamics refers to the computer simulation of a material at the atomic level. An open problem in numerical analysis is to explain the apparent reliability of molecular dynamics simulations. The difficulty is that individual trajectories computed in molecular dynamics are accurate for only short time intervals, whereas apparently reliable information can be extracted from very long-time simulations. It has been conjectured that long molecular dynamics trajectories have low-dimensional statistical features that accurately approximate those of the original system. Another conjecture is that numerical trajectories satisfy the shadowing property: that they are close over long time intervals to exact trajectories but with different initial conditions. We prove that these two views are actually equivalent to each other, after we suitably modify the concept of shadowing. A key ingredient of our result is a general theorem that allows us to take random elements of a metric space that are close in distribution and embed them in the same probability space so that they are close in a strong sense. This result is similar to the Strassen-Dudley Theorem except that a mapping is provided between the two random elements. Our results on shadowing are motivated by molecular dynamics but apply to the approximation of any dynamical system when initial conditions are selected according to a probability measure."
1732951,"We show that if $G$ is any $p$-group of class at most two and exponent $p$, then there exist groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ of class two and exponent $p$ that contain $G$, neither of which can be expressed as a central product, and with $G_1$ capable and $G_2$ not capable. We provide upper bounds for ${\rm rank}(G_i^{\rm ab})$ in terms of ${\rm rank}(G^{\rm ab})$ in each case."
1732952,"This paper is devoted to the study of some coherent sheaves on non reduced curves that can be locally embedded in smooth surfaces. If Y is such a curve then there is a filtration by subschemes C_i such that C_1 is the reduced curve associated to Y, and that for every P in C, if z is an equation of C_1 in the local ring of Y at P, then (z^i) is the ideal of C_i. A coherent sheaf on Y is called torsion free if it does not have any non zero subsheaf with finite support. We prove that torsion free sheaves are reflexive. We study then the quasi locally free sheaves, i.e. sheaves which are locally isomorphic to direct sums of the structure sheaves of the C_i. We define an invariant for these sheaves, the complete type, and prove the irreducibility of the set of sheaves of given complete type. We study the generic quasi locally free sheaves, with applications to the moduli spaces of stable sheaves on Y."
1732953,"We study the 3-algebraic structure involved in the recently shown M2-branes worldvolume gauge theories. We first extend an arbitrary finite dimensional 3-algebra into an infinite dimensional 3-algebra by adding a mode number to each generator. A unique central charge in the algebra of gauge transformations appears naturally in this extension. We present an infinite dimensional extended 3-algebra with a general metric and also a different extension with a Lorentzian metric. We then study ordinary finite dimensional 3-algebras with different signatures of the metric, focusing on the cases with a negative eigenvalue and the cases with a zero eigenvalue. In the latter cases we present a new algebra, whose corresponding theory is a decoupled abelian gauge theory together with a free theory with global gauge symmetry, and there is no negative kinetic term from this algebra."

Finally, we have clarified the canonical structure of the dual theory in relation to the original Ashtekar theory. Comment: 26 pages"
1732955,"We develop here a relatively simple description of dark energy based on the dynamics of non-minimally coupled to gravity phantom scalar field which, in limit, corresponds to cosmological constant. The dark energy equation of state, obtained directly from the dynamics of the model, turns out to be an oscillatory function of the scale factor. This parameterisation is compared to other possible dark energy parameterisations, among them, the most popular one, linear in the scale factor. We use the Bayesian framework for model selection and make a comparison in the light of SN Ia, CMB shift parameter, BAO A parameter, observational H(z) and growth rate function data. We find that there is evidence to favour a parameterisation with oscillations over {\it a priori} assumed linear one. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figs, extended analysis, refs. added, PLB (in press)"
1732956,"We study the azimuthal angular dependence of back-to-back di-jet production in unpolarized hadron scattering $H_A+H_B \to J_1 + J_2 +X$, arising from the product of two Boer-Mulders functions, which describe the transverse spin distribution of quarks inside an unpolarized hadron. We find that when the di-jet is of two identical quarks ($J_q+J_q$) or a quark-antiquark pair ($J_q+J_{\bar{q}}$), there is a $\cos \delta \phi$ angular dependence of the di-jet, with $\delta \phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$, and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are the azimuthal angles of the two individual jets. In the case of $J_q+J_q$ production, we find that there is a color factor enhancement in the gluonic cross-section, compared with the result from the standard generalized parton model. We estimate the $\cos \delta \phi$ asymmetry of di-jet production at RHIC, showing that the color factor enhancement in the angular dependent of $J_q+J_q$ production will reverse the sign of the asymmetry."
1732957,"When modeling game situations of incomplete information one usually considers the players' hierarchies of beliefs, a source of all sorts of complications. Hars\'anyi (1967-68)'s idea henceforth referred to as the ""Hars\'anyi program"" is that hierarchies of beliefs can be replaced by ""types"". The types constitute the ""type space"". In the purely measurable framework Heifetz and Samet (1998) formalize the concept of type spaces and prove the existence and the uniqueness of a universal type space. Meier (2001) shows that the purely measurable universal type space is complete, i.e., it is a consistent object. With the aim of adding the finishing touch to these results, we will prove in this paper that in the purely measurable framework every hierarchy of beliefs can be represented by a unique element of the complete universal type space."
1732958,"We discuss the nature of pressure induced phase transitions in standard Quantum Paraelectrics near quantum critical point. From a microscopic theory we first show that near the critical point the transition temperature $T_c(p)$ varies as $ (1-p/p_c)^\xi$ with $\xi={1/2}$. Within the Landau scheme, it is shown that for $\xi \leq 1$, a condition satisfied by most quantum paraelectrics the transition is inevitably first order in nature.

1732960,"We report on radio observations of the M8.5 dwarf LSR J1835+3259 and the L3.5 dwarf 2MASS J00361617+1821104, which provide the strongest evidence to date that the electron cyclotron maser instability is the dominant mechanism producing radio emission in the magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs. As has previously been reported for the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, periodic pulses of 100% circularly polarized, coherent radio emission are detected from both dwarfs with periods of 2.84 +/- 0.01 and 3.08 +/- 0.05 hours respectively for LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS J00361617+1821104. Importantly, periodic unpolarized radio emission is also detected from 2MASS J00361617+1821104, and brightness temperature limitations rule out gyrosynchrotron radiation as a source of this radio emission. The unpolarized emission from this and other ultracool dwarfs is also attributed to electron cyclotron maser emission, which has become depolarized on traversing the ultracool dwarf magnetosphere, possibly due to propagations effects such as scattering. Based on available v sin i data in the literature and rotation periods derived from the periodic radio data for the three confirmed sources of electron cyclotron maser emission, TVLM 513-46546, LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS J00361617+1821104, we determine that the rotation axes of all three dwarfs are close to perpendicular to our line of sight. This suggests a possible geometrical selection effect due to the inherent directivity of electron cyclotron maser emission, that may account for the previously reported relationship between radio activity and v sin i observed for ultracool dwarfs. We also determine the radius of the dwarf LSR J1835+3259 to be > 0.117 +/- 0.012 R_Sol. (abridged) Comment: 11 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"
1732961,"NGC 1313 X-2 is one of the brightest ultraluminous X-ray sources in the sky, at both X-ray and optical wavelengths; therefore, quite a few studies of available ESO VLT and HST data have appeared in the literature. Here, we present our analysis of VLT/FORS1 and HST/ACS photometric data, confirming the identification of the B ~ 23 mag blue optical counterpart. We show that the system is part of a poor cluster with an age of 20 Myr, leading to an upper mass limit of some 12 M_sun for the mass donor. We attribute the different results with respect to earlier studies to the use of isochrones in the F435W and F555W HST/ACS photometric system that appear to be incompatible with the corresponding Johnson B and V isochrones. The counterpart exhibits significant photometric variability of about 0.2 mag amplitude, both between the two HST observations and during the one month of monitoring with the VLT. This includes variability within one night and suggests that the light is dominated by the accretion disk in the system and not by the mass donor. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures.

1732962,"We study the evolution of biased domain walls in the early universe. We explicitly discuss the roles played by the surface tension and volume pressure in the evolution of the walls, and quantify their effects by looking at the collapse of spherical wall solutions. We then apply our results to a particular mechanism, known as the devaluation scenario, in which the dynamics of biased domain walls was suggested as a possible solution to the cosmological constant problem. Our results indicate that devaluation will in general lead to values of the cosmological constant that differ by several orders of magnitude from the observationally inferred value, $\rho^{1/4}_{vac}\sim10^{-3} \rm eV$. We also argue that the reasons behind this are not specific to a particular realization, and are expected to persist in any scenario of this kind, except if a low energy cut-off on the spectra of vacuum energy densities, of the order of the critical density at the present time, is postulated. This implies that any such scenario will require a fine-tuning similar to the usual one."
1732963,"In this paper, we show that if a single sterile neutrino exists such that , it can serendipitously solve all outstanding issues of the Modified Newtonian Dynamics. We focus on fitting the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in detail which is possible using a flat Universe with and the usual baryonic and dark energy components. One cannot match the CMB if there is more than one massive sterile neutrino, nor with three active neutrinos of 2 eV. This model has the same expansion history as the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model and only differs at the galactic scale, where the modified dynamics outperform ΛCDM comprehensively. We discuss how an 11 eV sterile neutrino can explain the dark matter of galaxy clusters without influencing individual galaxies and potentially match the matter power spectrum."
1732964,"This continuing study of intragroup light in compact groups of galaxies aims to establish new constraints to models of formation and evolution of galaxy groups, specially of compact groups, which are a key part in the evolution of larger structures, such as clusters. In this paper we present three additional groups (HCG 15, 35 and 51) using deep wide-field B- and R-band images observed with the LAICA camera at the 3.5-m telescope at the Calar Alto observatory (CAHA). This instrument provides us with very stable flat-fielding, a mandatory condition for reliably measuring intragroup diffuse light. The images were analysed with the ov_wav package, a wavelet technique that allows us to uncover the intragroup component in an unprecedented way. We have detected that 19, 15 and 26 per cent of the total light of HCG 15, 35 and 51, respectively, are in the diffuse component, with colours that are compatible with old stellar populations and with mean surface brightness that can be as low as 28.4 B mag arcsec−2.

DM particles of the parent halo are accreted in the protostellar interior by adiabatic contraction and scattering/capture processes, reaching central densities of O(1012 GeV cm−3) at radii of the order of 10 au. Energy release from annihilation reactions can effectively counteract the gravitational collapse, in agreement with results from other groups. We find this stalling phase (known as a dark star) is transient and lasts from 2.1 × 103yr (M*= 600 M⊙) to 1.8 × 104yr (M*= 9 M⊙). Later in the evolution, DM scattering/capture rate becomes high enough that energy deposition from annihilations significantly alters the pre-MS evolution of the star in a way that depends on DM (i) velocity dispersion, , (ii) density, ρ, (iii) elastic scattering cross-section with baryons, σ0. For our fiducial set of parameters we find that the evolution of stars of mass M* < 40 M⊙‘freezes’ on the HR diagram before reaching the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Stars with M*≥ 40 M⊙ manage to ignite nuclear reactions; however, DM ‘burning’ prolongs their lifetimes by a factor of 2 (5) for a 600 M⊙ (40 M⊙) star. For ρ≳ 1012GeV cm−3, and same values of the other parameters, we find that all our models are entirely supported by DM annihilation and ‘freeze’ on the HR diagram before igniting nuclear reactions."
1732966,"We present the final installment of an intensive 13 year study of variations of the optical continuum and broad Hβ emission line in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548. The database consists of 1530 optical continuum measurements and 1248 Hβ measurements. The Hβ variations follow the continuum variations closely, with a typical time delay of about 20 days. However, a year-by-year analysis shows that the magnitude of emission-line time delay is correlated with the mean continuum flux. We argue that the data are consistent with the simple model prediction between the size of the broad-line region and the ionizing luminosity, r L. Moreover, the apparently linear nature of the correlation between the Hβ response time and the nonstellar optical continuum Fopt arises as a consequence of the changing shape of the continuum as it varies, specifically Fopt F."
1732967,"We uncover a disorder-driven instability in the diffusive Fermi liquid phase of a class of many-fermion systems, indicative of a metal-insulator transition of first order type, which arises solely from the competition between quenched disorder and interparticle interactions. Our result is expected to be relevant for sufficiently strong disorder in d = 3 spatial dimensions. Specifically, we study a class of half-filled, Hubbard-like models for spinless fermions with (complex) random hopping and short-ranged interactions on bipartite lattices, in d > 1. In a given realization, the hopping disorder breaks time reversal invariance, but preserves the special ``nesting'' symmetry responsible for the charge density wave instability of the ballistic Fermi liquid. This disorder may arise, e.g., from the application of a random magnetic field to the otherwise clean model. We derive a low energy effective field theory description for this class of disordered, interacting fermion systems, which takes the form of a Finkel'stein non-linear sigma model [A. M. Finkel'stein, Zh. Eksp. Teor. Fiz. 84, 168 (1983), Sov. Phys. JETP 57, 97 (1983)]. We analyze the Finkel'stein sigma model using a perturbative, one-loop renormalization group analysis controlled via an epsilon-expansion in d = 2 + epsilon dimensions. We find that, in d = 2 dimensions, the interactions destabilize the conducting phase known to exist in the disordered, non-interacting system. The metal-insulator transition that we identify in d > 2 dimensions occurs for disorder strengths of order epsilon, and is therefore perturbatively accessible for epsilon << 1. We emphasize that the disordered system has no localized phase in the absence of interactions, so that a localized phase, and the transition into it, can only appear due to the presence of the interactions.

1732968,"In eukaryotic genomes, nucleosomes function to compact DNA and to regulate access to it both by simple physical occlusion and by providing the substrate for numerous covalent epigenetic tags. While nucleosome positions in vitro are determined by sequence alone, in vivo competition with other DNA-binding factors and action of chromatin remodeling enzymes play a role that needs to be quantified. We developed a biophysical model for the sequence dependence of DNA bending energies, and validated it against a collection of in vitro free energies of nucleosome formation and a nucleosome crystal structure; we also successfully designed both strong and poor histone binding sequences ab initio. For in vivo data from S.cerevisiae, the strongest positioning signal came from the competition with other factors. Based on sequence alone, our model predicts that functional transcription factor binding sites have a tendency to be covered by nucleosomes, but are uncovered in vivo because functional sites cluster within a single nucleosome footprint, making transcription factors bind cooperatively. Similarly a weak enhancement of nucleosome binding in the TATA region for naked DNA becomes a strong depletion when the TATA-binding protein is included, in quantitative agreement with experiment. Predictions at specific loci were also greatly enhanced by including competing factors. Our physically grounded model distinguishes multiple ways in which genomic sequence can influence nucleosome positions and thus provides an alternative explanation for several important experimental findings."
1732969,"We investigate the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR) and dense molecular gas mass in the nuclei of galaxies. To do this, we utilize the observed 850 micron luminosity as a proxy for the infrared luminosity and SFR, and correlate this with the observed CO (J=3-2) luminosity. We find tentative evidence that the LIR-CO (J=3-2) index is similar to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) index (N ~ 1.5) in the central ~1.7 kpc of galaxies, and flattens to a roughly linear index when including emission from the entire galaxy. This result may imply that the volumetric Schmidt relation is the underlying driver behind the observed SFR-dense gas correlations, and provides tentative confirmation for recent numerical models. While the data exclude the possibility of a constant LIR-CO (J=3-2) index for both galaxy nuclei and global measurements at the ~80% confidence level, the considerable error bars cannot preclude alternative interpretations.

1732970,"Existing models of network growth typically have one or two parameters or strategies which are fixed for all times. We introduce a general framework where feedback on the current state of a network is used to dynamically alter the values of such parameters. A specific model is analyzed where limited resources are shared among arriving nodes, all vying to connect close to the root. We show that tunable feedback leads to growth of larger, more efficient networks. Exact results show that linear scaling of resources with system size yields crossover to a trivial condensed state, which can be considerably delayed with sublinear scaling."
1732971,"The ternary iron arsenide BaFe2As2, with the tetragonal ThCr2Si2-type structure, exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) anomaly at 140 K, very similar to LaFeAsO, which is the parent compound of the iron arsenide superconductors. BaFe2As2 is a poor Pauli-paramagnetic metal and undergoes a structural and magnetic phase transition at 140 K, accompanied by strong anomalies in the specific heat, electrical resistance, and magnetic susceptibility. In the course of this transition, the space-group symmetry changes from tetragonal (I4/mmm) to orthorhombic (Fmmm). Fe-57 Mossbauer spectroscopy experiments show a single signal at room temperature and full hyperfine field splitting below the phase-transition temperature (5.2 T at 77 K). Our results suggest that BaFe2As2 can serve as a parent compound for oxygen-free iron arsenide superconductors."
1732972,"We present the XMM-Newton Medium sensitivity Survey (XMS), including a total of 318 X-ray sources found among the serendipitous content of 25 XMM-Newton target fields. The XMS comprises four largely overlapping source samples selected at soft (0.5-2 keV), intermediate (0.5-4.5 keV), hard (2-10 keV) and ultra-hard (4.5-7.5 keV) bands, the first three of them being flux-limited. We report on the optical identification of the XMS samples, complete to 85-95%. At the intermediate flux levels sampled by the XMS we find that the X-ray sky is largely dominated by Active Galactic Nuclei. The fraction of stars in soft X-ray selected samples is below 10%, and only a few per cent for hard selected samples. We find that the fraction of optically obscured objects in the AGN population stays constant at around 15-20% for soft and intermediate band selected X-ray sources, over 2 decades of flux. The fraction of obscured objects amongst the AGN population is larger (~35-45%) in the hard or ultra-hard selected samples, and constant across a similarly wide flux range. The distribution in X-ray-to-optical flux ratio is a strong function of the selection band, with a larger fraction of sources with high values in hard selected samples. Sources with X-ray-to-optical flux ratios in excess of 10 are dominated by obscured AGN, but with a significant contribution from unobscured AGN. Comment: A&A, accepted"
1732973,"In this work we show that the presence of a vector field on cosmological scales could explain the present phase of accelerated expansion of the universe. The proposed theory contains no dimensional parameters nor potential terms and does not require unnatural initial conditions in the early universe, thus avoiding the so called cosmic coincidence problem. In addition, it fits the data from high-redshift supernovae with excellent precision, making definite predictions for cosmological parameters. Upcoming observations will be able to clearly discriminate this model from standard cosmology with cosmological constant."
1732974,"This paper presents a numerical compression strategy for the boundary integral equation of acoustic scattering in two dimensions. These equations have oscillatory kernels that we represent in a basis of wave atoms, and compress by thresholding the small coefficients to zero. This phenomenon was perhaps first observed in 1993 by Bradie, Coifman, and Grossman, in the context of local Fourier bases (Bradie et al. in Appl. Comput. Harmon. Anal. 1:94–99, 1993). Their results have since then been extended in various ways. The purpose of this paper is to bridge a theoretical gap and prove that a well-chosen fixed expansion, the non-standard wave atom form, provides a compression of the acoustic single- and double-layer potentials with wave number k as O(k)-by-O(k) matrices with C ε δ k 1+δ non-negligible entries, with δ>0 arbitrarily small, and ε the desired accuracy. The argument assumes smooth, separated, and not necessarily convex scatterers in two dimensions. The essential features of wave atoms that allow this result to be written as a theorem are a sharp time-frequency localization that wavelet packets do not obey, and a parabolic scaling (wavelength of the wave packet) ∼ (essential diameter)2. Numerical experiments support the estimate and show that this wave atom representation may be of interest for applications where the same scattering problem needs to be solved for many boundary conditions, for example, the computation of radar cross sections."
1732975,"In this paper, we consider the problem of robust joint source-channel coding over an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We propose a new scheme which achieves the optimal slope for the signal-to-distortion (SDR) curve (unlike the previous known coding schemes). We also drive some theoretical bounds on the asymptotic performance of delay-limited hybrid digital-analog (HDA) coding schemes. We show that, unlike the delay-unlimited case, for any family of HDA codes, the asymptotic performance loss is unbounded (in terms of dB)."

1732977,"In this paper, the following two propositions are proven under the dominant energy condition for the matter field in the higher-dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in the presence of a cosmological constant $\Lambda$. First, for $\Lambda\le 0$ and $\alpha \ge 0$ without a fine-tuning to give a unique anti-de Sitter vacuum, where $\alpha$ is the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, vanishing generalized Misner-Sharp mass is equivalent to the maximally symmetric spacetime. Under the fine-tuning, it is equivalent to the vacuum class I spacetime. Second, under the fine-tuning with $\alpha>0$, the asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime in the higher-dimensional Henneaux-Teitelboim sense is only a special class of the vacuum class I spacetime. The latter means the universal slow fall-off to the unique anti-de Sitter infinity in the presence of physically reasonable matter.

1732978,"We describe algorithms and experimental strategies for the Pareto optimal control problem of simultaneously driving an arbitrary number of quantum observable expectation values to their respective extrema. Conventional quantum optimal control strategies are less effective at sampling points on the Pareto frontier of multiobservable control landscapes than they are at locating optimal solutions to single observable control problems. The present algorithms facilitate multiobservable optimization by following direct paths to the Pareto front, and are capable of continuously tracing the front once it is found to explore families of viable solutions. The numerical and experimental methodologies introduced are also applicable to other problems that require the simultaneous control of large numbers of observables, such as quantum optimal mixed state preparation."
1732979,The notion of a root functional of polynomials is a generalization of the notion of a root for a multiple root. A root functional is a linear functional that is defined on a polynomial ring and annuls the ideal of a system of polynomials. A bounded root functional is a functional that annuls d-th component of the ideal in some filtration in this ideal. It was constructed the operation of continuation of root functionals and the operation of reduction of polynomials modulo the ideal on the basis of the extension operation for bounded root functionals when the number of polynomials is equal to the number of variables and the ideal of polynomials is 0-dimensional. The extension operation has connection with the multivariate Bezoutian construction.
1732980,We propose a route to a one-dimensional Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in the absence of broken time-reversal symmetry. At present such a state may be encouraged in a clean (no disorder) AlAs quantum wire fabricated using the cleaved edge overgrowth technique. The fabrication technique captures two degenerate nonoverlapping bands separated in momentum-space by half an umklapp vector which leads to four Fermi points. Using field theoretic methods such as abelian bosonization and the renormalization group scheme we treat the important low energy long wavelength fermionic interaction terms for this one dimensional system. Due to the specific bandstructure arrangement of the quantum wire there is a new class of unique umklapp assisted interactions. These umklapp interactions are present at all electronic densities and are not related to the commensurability of the electron gas with the underlying lattice. We show that in the presence of the umklapp interactions and without any external perturbations such as a magnetic or electric field a singlet superconducting ground state is preferred with non-zero center-of-mass momentum for the Cooper pairs. The finite pairing momentum of the Cooper pairs is an indication of a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state which is known to lead to inhomogeneous superconductivity.
1732981,"Concurrent ML's events and event combinators facilitate modular concurrent programming with first-class synchronization abstractions. A standard implementation of these abstractions relies on fairly complex manipulations of first-class continuations in the underlying language. In this paper, we present a lightweight implementation of these abstractions in Concurrent Haskell, a language that already provides first-order message passing. At the heart of our implementation is a new distributed synchronization protocol. In contrast with several previous translations of event abstractions in concurrent languages, we remain faithful to the standard semantics for events and event combinators; for example, we retain the symmetry of $\mathtt{choose}$ for expressing selective communication."
1732982,"Within the framework of a generalized collinear factorization for multiple parton scattering in nuclear medium, twist-4 contributions to DIS off a large nucleus can be factorized as a convolution of hard parts and two-parton correlation functions. The hard parts for the quark scattering in the light-cone gauge correspond to interaction with a transverse (physical) gluon in the target, while they are given by the second derivative of the cross section with a longitudinal gluon in the covariant gauge. We provide a general proof of the equivalence of the hard parts in the light-cone and covariant gauge. We further demonstrate the equivalence in calculations of twist-4 contributions to semi-inclusive cross section of DIS in both lowest order and next leading order. Calculations of the nuclear transverse momentum broadening of the struck quark in the light-cone and covariant gauge are also discussed."
1732983,We study non-minimal quantum fields in the gravitational field of 2-dimensional dilaton black holes and the de Sitter spacetime. We found that the Green functions for non-minimal massless fields in a particular class of dilaton black holes and in the de Sitter spacetime are almost identical. Using this symmetry exact solutions are derived for quasinormal modes and bound states in these background geometries. The problem of stability of dilaton black holes is discussed.
1732984,"We present a proposal to generate an optical vortex beam by using the coherent-superposition of multi-beams in a radially symmetric configuration. In terms of the generalized Huygens–Fresnel diffraction integral, we have derived the general propagation expression for the coherent radial arrays of laser beams. Using the derived formulae, we have analyzed the effects of the beamlet number N, the separation distance ρ of the beamlets and the topological charge m on the intensity and phase distributions of the resultant beams. Our simulation results show that optical vortices could be efficiently generated due to the coherent-superposition effect of all beamlets, during the propagation process of the coherent radial array of laser beams with the initial well-organized phase distributions through the free space. In the focusing system, the resultant beam near the focusing plane has the strong rotational effect with the phase helicity."
1732985,"The primary objective of the Beyond Einstein Advanced Coherent Optical Network (BEACON) mission is a search for new physics beyond general relativity by measuring the curvature of relativistic space-time around Earth. This curvature is characterized by the Eddington parameter \gamma -- the most fundamental relativistic gravity parameter and a direct measure for the presence of new physical interactions. BEACON will achieve an accuracy of 1 x 10^{-9} in measuring the parameter \gamma, thereby going a factor of 30,000 beyond the present best result involving the Cassini spacecraft. Secondary mission objectives include: (i) a direct measurement of the ""frame-dragging"" and geodetic precessions in the Earth's rotational gravitomagnetic field, to 0.05% and 0.03% accuracy correspondingly, (ii) first measurement of gravity's non-linear effects on light and corresponding 2nd order spatial metric's effects to 0.01% accuracy. BEACON will lead to robust advances in tests of fundamental physics -- this mission could discover a violation or extension of general relativity and/or reveal the presence of an additional long range interaction in physics. BEACON will provide crucial information to separate modern scalar-tensor theories of gravity from general relativity, probe possible ways for gravity quantization, and test modern theories of cosmological evolution.

1732986,"LS 5039 is one of a handful of X-ray binaries that have been recently detected at high-energy $\gamma$-rays, in this case, by the High-Energy Stereoscopy Array (H.E.S.S.). The nature of this system is unknown: both a black hole and a pulsar have been invoked as possible compact object companions. Here we work with a model of the high energy phenomenology of the system in which it is assumed that the companion object is a pulsar rotating around an O6.5V star in the $\sim 3.9$ days orbit. The model assumes two different sets of power-law spectral parameters of the interacting primary leptons corresponding to the two orbital phase intervals defined by H.E.S.S. as having different gamma-ray spectra and very-high-energy (VHE) cutoffs. We show the H.E.S.S. phenomenology is completely explained by this model. We present predictions for photons with lower energies (for $E>1 $ GeV), subject to test in the forthcoming months with the GLAST satellite. We find that GLAST is able to judge on this model within one year. Comment: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters"

1732988,"We report the theory of the \emph{dynamical response of current fluctuations} of a photo-excited conductor. We have performed the calculation for a coherent conductor described by arbitrary energy-dependent transmissions and for arbitrary frequencies. We consider two experimental setups that correspond to different ways of symmetrizing the current operators, leading to different predictions. Our results are in very good, quantitative agreement with a recent measurement. We demonstrate that the dynamical response of noise that we have calculated is the key concept that relates Dynamical Coulomb Blockade, i.e. the electron-electron correction to the conductance due to the presence of an external impedance, to quantum noise."
1732989,"Significant insights into non-Abelian quantum Hall states are obtained from studying special multiparticle interaction Hamiltonians, whose unique ground states are the Moore-Read and Read-Rezayi states for the case of spinless electrons. We generalize this approach to include the electronic spin-1/2 degree of freedom. We demonstrate that in the absence of Zeeman splitting, the ground states of such Hamiltonians have large degeneracies and very rich spin structures. The spin structure of the ground states and low-energy excitations can be understood based on an emergent SU(3) symmetry for the case corresponding to the Moore-Read state. These states with different spin quantum numbers represent non-Abelian quantum Hall states with different magnetizations, whose quasihole properties are likely to be similar to those of their spin-polarized counterparts."
1732990,"We examine the ability of a future X-ray observatory, with capabilities similar to those planned for the Constellation-X or X-ray Evolving Universe Spectroscopy (XEUS) missions, to constrain dark energy via measurements of the cluster X-ray gas mass fraction, fgas. We find that fgas measurements for a sample of ∼ 500 hot (kT � 5keV), X-ray bright, dynamically relaxed clusters, to a precision of ∼ 5 per cent, can be used to constrain dark energy with a Dark Energy Task Force (DETF; Albrecht et al. 2006) figure of merit of 15 − 40, with the possibility of boosting these values by 40 per cent or more by optimizing the redshift distribution of target clusters. Such constraints are comparable to those predicted by the DETF for other leading, planned ‘Stage IV ’ dark energy experiments. A future fgas experiment will be preceded by a large X-ray or SZ survey that will find hot, X-ray luminous clusters out to high redshifts. Short ‘snapshot ’ observations with the new X-ray observatory should then be able to identify a sample of ∼ 500 suitably relaxed systems. The redshift, temperature and X-ray luminosity range of interest has already been partially probed by existing X-ray"
1732991,"We show that an equivariant vector bundle on a complete toric variety is nef or ample if and only if its restriction to every invariant curve is nef or ample, respectively. Furthermore, we show that nef toric vector bundles have a nonvanishing global section at every point, and deduce that the underlying vector bundle is trivial if and only if its restriction to every invariant curve is trivial. We apply our methods and results to study, in particular, the vector bundles M_L that arise as the kernel of the evaluation map on sections of L, when L is an ample line bundle. We give examples of twists of such bundles that are ample but not globally generated. Comment: 28 pages; revised version, to appear in Ann. Inst. Fourier (Grenoble)"
1732992,In this paper we considered a quantum particle moving through delute Bose-Einstein condensate at zero temperature. In our formulation the impurity particle interacts with the gas of uncoupled Bogoliubov's excitations. We constructed the perturbation theory for the Green's function of the impurity particle with respect to the impurity-condensate interaction employing the coherent-state path integral approach. The perturbative expansion for the Green's function is resumed into the expansion for its poles with the help of the diagrammatic technique developed in this work. The dispersion relation for the impurity clothed by condensate excitations is obtained and effective mass is evaluated beyond the Golden rule approximation.
1732993,"We revisit general arguments for the absence of exact continuous global symmetries in string compactifications and extend them to D-brane models. We elucidate the various ways approximate continuous global symmetries arise in the 4-dimensional effective action. In addition to two familiar methods - axionic Peccei-Quinn symmetries and remnant global abelian symmetries from Green-Schwarz gauge symmetry breaking - we identify new ways to generate approximate continuous global symmetries. Two methods stand out, both of which occur for local brane constructions within the LARGE volume scenario of moduli stabilisation. The first is the generic existence of continuous non-abelian global symmetries associated with local Calabi-Yau isometries. These symmetries are exact in the non-compact limit and are spontaneously broken by the LARGE volume, with breaking effects having phenomenologically interesting sizes ( ~ 0.01) for plausible choices for underlying parameters. Such approximate flavour symmetries are phenomenologically attractive and may allow the fermion mass hierarchies to be connected to the electroweak hierarchy via the large volume. The second is the possible existence of new hyper-weak gauge interactions under which Standard Model matter is charged, with αHW ~ 10−9. Such groups arise from branes wrapping bulk cycles and intersecting the local (resolved) singularity on which the Standard Model is supported. We discuss experimental bounds for these new gauge bosons and their interactions with the Standard Model particles."
1732994,"Perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) boundary conditions are dual to the more familiar perfect electric conductor (PEC) conditions and can be viewed as the electromagnetic analog of the boundary conditions in the bag model for hadrons in QCD. Recent advances and requirements in communication technologies have attracted great interest in PMC’s, and Casimir experiments involving structures that approximate PMC’s may be carried out in the not-too-distant future. In this paper, we make a study of the zero-temperature PMC Casimir piston in d+1 dimensions. The PMC Casimir energy is explicitly evaluated by summing over p+1-dimensional Dirichlet energies where p ranges from 2 to d inclusively. We derive two exact d-dimensional expressions for the Casimir force on the piston and find that the force is negative (attractive) in all dimensions. Both expressions are applied to the case of 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. A spin-off from our work is a contribution to the PEC literature: we obtain a useful alternative expression for the PEC Casimir piston in 3+1 dimensions and also evaluate the Casimir force per unit area on an infinite strip, a geometry of experimental interest."
1732995,"We present azimuthal anisotropy measurements in Au+Au and Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV. Comparison between reaction plane and cumulant $v_2$ measurements in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV show that non-flow contributions, originating mainly from jets, influence the extracted $v_2$ for $p_T$ $\gtrsim$ 3.5 GeV/c. Number of constituent quark (NCQ) scaling of $v_2$, when studied as a function of transverse kinetic energy $KE_T$, is seen to hold for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 62.4 and 200 GeV and for Cu+Cu collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV for $KE_{T}$ $\lesssim$ 1 GeV/c.

1732996,"Well-determined physical parameters of 130 W UMa systems have been collected from the literature. Based on these data, the evolutionary status and dynamical evolution of W UMa systems are investigated. It is found that there is no evolutionary difference between W- and A-type systems in $M-J$ diagram which is consistent with the results derived from the analysis of observed spectral type, $M-R$ and $M-L$ diagrams of W UMa systems. $M-R$ and $M-L$ diagrams of W- and A-type systems indicate that a large amount of energy should be transferred from the more massive to the less massive component so that they are not in thermal equilibrium and undergo thermal relaxation oscillation (TRO). Meanwhile, the distribution of angular momentum, together with the distribution of mass ratio, suggests that the mass ratio of the observed W UMa systems is decreased with the decrease of their total mass. This could be the result of the dynamical evolution of W UMa systems which suffer angular momentum loss (AML) and mass loss due to magnetic stellar wind (MSW). Consequently, the tidal instability forces these systems towards the lower q values and finally to fast rotating single stars. Comment: 8 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS"
1732997,"Theoretical study indicates that a contact binary system would merge into a rapidly rotating single star due to tidal instability when the spin angular momentum of the system is more than a third of its orbital angular momentum. Assuming that W Ursae Majoris (W UMa) contact binary systems rigorously comply with the Roche geometry and the dynamical stability limit is at a contact degree of about 70 per cent, we obtain that W UMa systems might suffer Darwin's instability when their mass ratios are in a region of about 0.076–0.078 and merge into the fast-rotating stars. This suggests that the W UMa systems with mass ratio q≤ 0.076 cannot be observed. Meanwhile, we find that the observed W UMa systems with a mass ratio of about 0.077, corresponding to a contact degree of about 86 per cent would suffer tidal instability and merge into the single fast-rotating stars. This suggests that the dynamical stability limit for the observed W UMa systems is higher than the theoretical value, implying that the observed systems have probably suffered the loss of angular momentum due to gravitational wave radiation (GR) or magnetic stellar wind (MSW)."
1732998,"Recent spectroscopic and high resolution $HST$-imaging observations have revealed significant numbers of ``passive'' spiral galaxies in distant clusters, with all the morphological hallmarks of a spiral galaxy (in particular, spiral arm structure), but with weak or absent star formation. Exactly how such spiral galaxies formed and whether they are the progenitors of present-day S0 galaxies is unclear. Based on analytic arguments and numerical simulations of the hydrodynamical evolution of a spiral galaxy's halo gas (which is a likely candidate for the source of gas replenishment for star formation in spirals), we show that the origin of passive spirals may well be associated with halo gas stripping. Such stripping results mainly from the hydrodynamical interaction between the halo gas and the hot intracluster gas. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that even if a spiral orbits a cluster with a pericenter distance $\sim$ 3 times larger than the cluster core radius, $\sim$ 80 % of the halo gas is stripped within a few Gyr and, accordingly, cannot be accreted by the spiral. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that this dramatic decline in the gaseous infall rate leads to a steady increase in the $Q$ parameter for the disk, with the spiral arm structure, although persisting, becoming less pronounced as the star formation rate gradually decreases. These results suggest that passive spirals formed in this way, gradually evolve into red cluster S0s. Comment: 13 pages 4 figures (fig.1 = jpg format), accepted by ApJ"
1732999,"A colossal electroresistance effect is observed around room temperature in a transition metal oxide LuFe2O4. The measurements of resistance under various applied voltages as well as the highly nonlinear current-voltage characteristics reveal that a small electric field is able to drive the material from the insulating state to a metallic state. The threshold field at which the insulating-metallic transition occurs, decreases exponentially with increasing temperature. We interpret this transition as a consequence of the breakdown of the charge-ordered state triggered by applied electric field, which is supported by the dramatic dielectric response in a small electric field. This colossal electroresistance effect as well as the high dielectric tunability around room temperature in low applied fields makes LuFe2O4 a very promising material for many applications."
1733000,"Static disorder in a noninteracting gas of electrons confined to two dimensions can drive a continuous quantum (Anderson) transition between a metallic and an insulating state when time-reversal symmetry is preserved but spin-rotation symmetry is broken. The critical exponent $\nu$ that characterizes the diverging localization length and the bulk multifractal scaling exponents that characterize the amplitudes of the critical wave functions at the metal-insulator transition do not depend on the topological nature of the insulating state, i.e., whether it is topologically trivial (ordinary insulator) or nontrivial (a $Z_2$ insulator supporting a quantum spin Hall effect). This is not true of the boundary multifractal scaling exponents which we show (numerically) to depend on whether the insulating state is topologically trivial or not."
1733001,"Several rare coincidences of scales in standard particle physics are needed to explain (i) why neutrinos have mass, (ii) why the negative pressure of the cosmological dark energy (DE) coincides with the positive pressure of random motion of dark matter (DM) in bright galaxies, (iii) why Dark Matter in galaxies seems to have a finite phase-space density, and to follow the Tully-Fisher-Milgrom relation of galaxy rotation curves. The old idea of self-interacting DM is given a new spin: we propose that the neutrino spin-gravity coupling could lead to a cosmic neutrino dark fluid with a an internal energy density varying as function of the local acceleration of the neutrino fluid with respect the CMB background. We link the Tully-Fisher-Milgrom relation of spiral galaxies (or MOND) with the relativistic pressure of the neutrino dark fluid without modifying Einsteinian gravity."
1733002,"We analyze transport of local magnetization and develop schemes to control transport behavior in finite spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains and spin-1/2 Heisenberg two-leg ladders at zero temperature. By adjusting parameters in the Hamiltonians, these quantum systems may show both integrable and chaotic limits. We provide examples of chaotic systems leading to diffusive and to ballistic transport. In addition, methods of coherent quantum control to induce a transition from diffusive to ballistic transport are proposed."
1733003,"We present results from a survey of 12 CO (J=1-0) spectra obtained for the central regions of 68 nearby galaxies at an angular resolution of 16"" using the Nobeyama Radio Observatory 45 m telescope, aimed at characterizing the properties of star-forming molecular gas. Combined with observations of similar resolution in the literature, the compiled sample set of 166 galaxies span a wide range of galactic properties. NGC 4380, which was previously undetected in CO, was detected. This initial paper of a series will focus on the data and the gaseous properties of the samples, and particularly on the degree of central concentration of molecular gas in a range of morphological types, from early (S0/Sa) to late (Sd/Sm) galaxies with and without bars. The degree of molecular central concentration in the central kiloparsec, compared with the central several kiloparsecs of galaxies, is found to vary smoothly with Hubble type, so that early-type galaxies show larger central concentration. The comparison of barred and nonbarred galaxies within early- and late-type galaxies suggest that difference in Hubble type, representing the effect of bulges, is the more important factor in concentrating gas into the central regions than bars."
1733004,"The following problem is NP-hard: given a regular expression $E$, decide if $E^*$ is not co-finite."
1733005,"The final state of the decay ${D}^{0}$\rightarrow${}{$\pi${}}^{+}{$\pi${}}^{$-${}}{$\pi${}}^{0}$ is analyzed in terms of isospin eigenstates. It is shown that the final state is dominated by the isospin-0 component. This suggests that isospin considerations may provide insight into this and perhaps other ${D}^{0}$-meson decays. We also discuss the isospin nature of the nonresonant contribution in the decay, which can be further understood by studying the decay ${D}^{0}$\rightarrow${}{$\pi${}}^{0}{$\pi${}}^{0}{$\pi${}}^{0}$."
1733006,"Differential cross sections for γp→K+Λ(1405) and γp→K+Σ0(1385) reactions have been measured in the photon energy range from 1.5 to 2.4 GeV and the angular range of 0.8<cos(Θ)<1.0 for the K+ scattering angle in the center-of-mass system. This data is the first measurement of the Λ(1405) photoproduction cross section. The line shapes of Λ(1405) measured in Σ+π- and Σ-π+ decay modes were different with each other, indicating a strong interference of the isospin 0 and 1 terms of the Σπ scattering amplitudes. The ratios of Λ(1405) production to Σ0(1385) production were measured in two photon energy ranges: near the production threshold (1.5<Eγ<2.0 GeV) and far from it (2.0<Eγ<2.4 GeV). The observed ratio decreased in the higher photon energy region, which may suggest different production mechanisms and internal structures for these hyperon resonances."
1733007,"We consider the problem of source coding with receiver side information for the simple network proposed by R. Gray and A. Wyner in 1974. In this network, a transmitter must reliably transport the output of two correlated information sources to two receivers using three noiseless channels: a public channel which connects the transmitter to both receivers, and two private channels which connect the transmitter directly to each receiver. We extend Gray and Wyner's original problem by permitting side information to be present at each receiver. We derive inner and outer bounds for the achievable rate region and, for three special cases, we show that the outer bound is tight."
1733008,"We present measurements and simulations of a transmission-line network that has been designed for cloaking applications in the microwave region. Here the network is not used for cloaking but for channelling electromagnetic fields through an electrically dense array of metal objects, which alone is basically impenetrable to the impinging electromagnetic radiation. With the designed transmission-line network the waves emitted by a source placed in an air-filled waveguide are coupled into the network and guided through the array of metallic objects. Our goal is to illustrate the simple manufacturing, assembly, and the general feasibility of cloaking devices based on the transmission-line approach. Most importantly, we demonstrate both with measurements and with numerical simulations the excellent coupling of waves between the network and the surrounding medium."
1733009,"Given a well-ordered semi-group $\Gamma$ with a minimal system of generators of ordinal type at most $\omega n$ and of rational rank $r$, which satisfies a positivity and increasing condition, we construct a zero-dimensional valuation centered on the ring of polynomials with $r$ variables such that the semi-group of the values of the polynomial ring is equal to $\Gamma$. The construction uses a generalization of Favre and Jonsson's version of MacLane's sequence of key-polynomials."
1733010,"I discuss some connotations of mathematical notion of ""truth"" in the context of humanistic discourse"
1733011,"We introduce photon-like refraction for gluon jet in quark gluon plasma created in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. A quark jet goes straightly while a gluon jet is assumed to bend in the non-homogeneous medium. Combining refraction and energy loss, we calculate the away-side dihadron $\Delta\phi$ distribution in central $Au+Au$ collisions at RHIC energy. The dihadrons from quark-quark pair center around $\Delta\phi=\pi$, while the dihadrons from quark-gluon and gluon-gluon pair are deflected from $\Delta\phi=\pi$. The resulting distribution shows three peaks at intermediate $p_T$ since both quark-quark and quark-gluon are important. However we only observe one center peak at high $p_T$, where the quark-quark contribution dominates. These observation qualitatively agrees with the experiment data."
1733012,"For an acyclic directed graph with multiple sources and multiple sinks, we prove that one can choose the Merger's paths between the sources and the sinks such that the number of mergings between these paths is upper bounded by a constant depending only on the min-cuts between the sources and the sinks, regardless of the size and topology of the graph. We also give bounds on the minimum number of mergings between these paths, and discuss how it depends on the min-cuts."
1733013,"We study the problem of power-efficient routing for multihop wireless ad hoc sensor networks. The guiding insight of our work is that unlike an ad hoc wireless network, a wireless ad hoc sensor network does not require full connectivity among the nodes. As long as the sensing region is well covered by connected nodes, the network can perform its task. We consider two kinds of geometric random graphs as base interconnection structures: unit disk graphs $\UDG(2,\lambda)$ and $k$-nearest-neighbor graphs $\NN(2,k)$ built on points generated by a Poisson point process of density $\lambda$ in $\RR^2$. We provide subgraph constructions for these two models $\US(2,\lambda)$ and $\NS(2,k)$ and show that there are values $\lambda_s$ and $k_s$ above which these constructions have the following good properties: (i) they are sparse; (ii) they are power-efficient in the sense that the graph distance is no more than a constant times the Euclidean distance between any pair of points; (iii) they cover the space well; (iv) the subgraphs can be set up easily using local information at each node. We also describe a simple local algorithm for routing packets on these subgraphs. Our constructions also give new upper bounds for the critical values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $k$ for the models $\UDG(2,\lambda)$ and $\NN(2,k)$."
1733014,"In 1960 Edward Lorenz (1917-2008) published a pioneering work on the `maximum simplification' of the barotropic vorticity equation. He derived a coupled three-mode system and interpreted it as the minimum core of large-scale fluid mechanics on a `finite but unbounded' domain. The model was obtained in a heuristic way, without giving a rigorous justification for the chosen selection of modes. In this paper, it is shown that one can legitimate Lorenz' choice by using symmetry transformations of the spectral form of the vorticity equation. The Lorenz three-mode model arises as the final step in a hierarchy of models constructed via the component reduction by means of symmetries. In this sense, the Lorenz model is indeed the `maximum simplification' of the vorticity equation. Comment: 8 pages, minor corrections"
1733015,"We present a Galois theory of difference equations designed to measure the differential dependencies among solutions of linear difference equations. With this we are able to reprove Hoelder's Theorem that the Gamma function satisfies no polynomial differential equation and are able to give general results that imply, for example, that no differential relationship holds among solutions of certain classes of q-hypergeometric functions."
1733016,"We derive a general formula for the reduced fidelity susceptibility when the reduced density matrix is 2x2 block diagonal. By using this result and a continuous unitary transformation, we study finite-size scaling of the reduced fidelity susceptibility in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model. It is found that it can well characterize quantum phase transitions, that is, we can extract information about quantum phase transitions from only the fidelity of a subsystem, which is of practical use in experiments."
1733017,"We investigate the axial-vector transition constants of the baryon antidecuplet to the octet and decuplet within the framework of the self-consistent SU(3) chiral quark-soliton model. Taking into account rotational 1/N_c and linear m_s corrections and using the symmetry-conserving quantization, we calculate the axial-vector transition constants. It is found that the leading-order contributions are generally almost canceled by the rotational 1/N_c corrections. Thus, the m_s corrections turn out to be essential contributions to the axial-vector constants. The decay width of the Theta^+ to NK transition is determined to be Gamma(Theta -> NK)=0.71, MeV, based on the result of the axial-vector transition constant g_A^* (Theta -> NK)=0.05. In addition, other strong decays of the baryon antidecuplet are investigated."
1733018,"We report on a significant improvement of the performance of the classical time-delayed autosynchronization method (TDAS) to control unstable steady states, by applying a time-varying delay in the TDAS control scheme in a form of a deterministic or stochastic delay modulation in a fixed interval around a nominal delay value. The successfulness of this variable-delay feedback control (VDFC) is illustrated by a numerical control simulation of the chaotic Lorenz system using three different types of time-delay modulations: a sawtooth wave, a sine wave, and a uniform random distribution. We perform a comparative analysis between the VDFC method and the standard TDAS method for a sawtooth wave modulation by analytically determining the domains of control for the generic case of an unstable fixed point of focus type."
1733019,"We show that the eigenspaces of the Dirac operator $H=\alpha\cdot (D - A(x)) + m \beta $ at the threshold energies $\pm m$ are coincide with the direct sum of the zero space and the kernel of the Weyl-Dirac operator $\sigma\cdot (D - A(x))$. Based on this result, we describe the asymptotic limits of the eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator corresponding to these threshold energies. Also, we discuss the set of vector potentials for which the kernels of $H\mp m$ are non-trivial, i.e. ${Ker}(H\mp m) \not = \{0 \}$."
1733020,"In view of the start up of the 14 TeV pp Large Hadron Collider the quark anti-quark reactions leading to the final states W^+W^-, W^+-Z^0 and Z^0Z^0 are studied, in the frame workn of the Standard Model (SM), using helicity amplitudes. The differential and total cross sections are first evaluated in the parton-parton center of mass system. They are then transformed to their expected behavior in pp collisions through the parton-parton Energy Density Functions which are here derived from the known Parton Density Functions of the proton. In particular the single and joint longitudinal polarizations of the final state di-bosons are calculated. The effect on these reactions from the presence of s-channel heavy vector bosons, like the W' and Z', are evaluated to explore the possibility to utilize the gauge boson pair production as a probe for these 'Beyond the SM' phenomena."
1733021,"In this paper, second post-Newtonian approximation of Einstein-aether theory is obtained by Chandrasekhar's approach. Five parameterized post-Newtonian parameters in first post-Newtonian approximation are presented after a time transformation and they are identical with previous works, in which $\gamma=1$, $\beta=1$ and two preferred-frame parameters remain. Meanwhile, in second post-Newtonian approximation, a parameter, which represents third order nonlinearity for gravity, is zero the same as in general relativity. For an application for future deep space laser ranging missions, we reduce the metric coefficients for light propagation in a case of $N$ point masses as a simplified model of the solar system. The resulting light deflection angle in second post-Newtonian approximation poses another constraint on the Einstein-aether theory."
1733022,"The dynamic interplay of transport, electrostatic, and magnetic effects in the resonant tunneling through ferromagnetic quantum wells is theoretically investigated. It is shown that the carrier-mediated magnetic order in the ferromagnetic region not only induces, but also takes part in intrinsic, robust, and sustainable high-frequency current oscillations over a large window of nominally steady bias voltages. This phenomenon could spawn a new class of quantum electronic devices based on ferromagnetic semiconductors."
1733023,"The recent claim of the ‘5 sigma’ observation of the Greisen-Zatzepin-Kuzmin cut-off by the HiRes group based on their nine years data is a significant step towards the eventual solution of one of the most intriguing questions in physics for more than 40 years. Recent results from Pierre Auger Observatory seem to confirm the statement. However, the word ‘significance’ is used in the mentioned paper in a sense which is not quite obvious. In the present paper we argue that this claim is a little premature."
1733024,"We prove that the multiplicity of each irreducible component in the $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$-cyclic module generated by the $l$-th power $\det^{(\alpha)}(X)^l$ of the $\alpha$-determinant is given by the rank of a matrix whose entries are given by a variation of the spherical Fourier transformation for $(\mathfrak{S}_{nl},\mathfrak{S}_l^n)$. Further, we calculate the matrix explicitly when $n=2$. This gives not only another proof of the result by Kimoto-Matsumoto-Wakayama (2007) but also a new aspect of the representation theory of the $\alpha$-determinants."
1733025,"To represent positive integers by regular patterns on a plane or in three-dimensional space may be traced back to the Pythagoreans. The aim of the present article is to explore the possibility of extending the representation framework for integers to spaces with more than three dimensions. Thus, taking up a definition of polygonal numbers given by Diophantus and by Nicomachus, and generalizing the Pythagorean concept of gnomon, one is led through quite elementary means to a single, unified definition of multidimensional number formations henceforth called hypersolids."
1733026,"We compute diffractive structure functions for both protons and nuclei in the framework of Color Glass Condensate models with impact parameter dependence. These models have previously been shown to provide good agreement with inclusive F_2 measurements and exclusive vector meson measurements at HERA. For nuclei, they provide good (parameter free) agreement with the inclusive F_2 data. We demonstrate good agreement of our computations with HERA measurements on inclusive diffraction. We extend our analysis to nuclei and predict the pattern of enhancement and suppression of the diffractive structures functions that can be measured at an Electron Ion Collider. We discuss how the impact parameter dependence crucially affects our analysis, in particular for large invariant masses at fixed Q^2."
1733027,"Imposing an extensional uniformity condition on a non-uniform circuit complexity class C means simply intersecting C with a uniform class L. By contrast, the usual intensional uniformity conditions require that a resource-bounded machine be able to exhibit the circuits in the circuit family defining C. We say that (C,L) has the ""Uniformity Duality Property"" if the extensionally uniform class C \cap L can be captured intensionally by means of adding so-called ""L-numerical predicates"" to the first-order descriptive complexity apparatus describing the connection language of the circuit family defining C. This paper exhibits positive instances and negative instances of the Uniformity Duality Property."
1733029,"An electric current flowing around a loop produces a magnetic field and hence a magnetic flux through the loop. The ratio of the magnetic flux to the electric current is called the (magnetic) self-inductance. Can there be a dual situation with a magnetic current flowing around a loop and producing an electric field and hence an electric flux through the loop? Following the classical electrodynamics laws an answer to this question should be negative. Nevertheless, special spectral properties of magnetic-dipolar modes in a quasi-two-dimensional ferrite disk show that there are the double-valued-function loop magnetic currents which may produce eigenelectric fields and hence eigenelectric fluxes through the loop. In this case one can definitely introduce a notion of an electric self-inductance as the ratio of the electric flux to the magnetic current. In this paper we show experimentally that in the magnetic-dipolar-mode ferrite disks there exist eigenelectric fluxes. These fluxes are very sensitive to the permittivity parameters of materials abutting to a ferrite disk. Dielectric samples above a ferrite disk with a higher permittivity than air confine the electric field closely outside the ferrite, thereby changing the loop magnetic currents and thus transforming the magnetic-dipolar-mode oscillating spectrum."
1733030,"The very first data from MAX-lab in Lund, Sweden on pion photoproduction at threshold energies are presented. The decrease of the total π+ yield in γ+12C, 27Al reactions below 200 MeV as well as the dσ/dΩ cross-section data essentially follow the predictions of an intranuclear-cascade model with an attractive potential for the pion–nucleus interaction. However, , cross-section data at 176 MeV show deviations which call for refinements of the model and possibly also for the inclusion of coherent pion-production mechanisms."
1733031,"Stimulated by recent observations of the excited bottom–strange mesons B s1 and B s2*, we calculate the semileptonic decays \(B_{s0},\,B_{s1}^{\prime},\,B_{s1},\,B_{s2}^{*}\to [D_{s}(1968),\linebreak D_{s}^{*}(2112),\,D_{sJ}(2317),\,D_{sJ}(2460)]\ell\bar{\nu}\) , which is relevant for the exploration of the potential of searching these semileptonic decays in experiment."
1733032,"The radio galaxy M87 has recently been found to be a rapidly variable TeV emitting source. We analyze the implications of the observed TeV characteristics and show that it proves challenging to account for them within conventional acceleration and emission models. We discuss a new pulsar-type scenario for the origin of variable, very high energy (VHE) emission close to the central supermassive black hole and show that magneto-centrifugally accelerated electrons could efficiently Compton upscatter sub-mm ADAF disk photons to the TeV regime, leading to VHE characteristics close to the observed ones. This suggests, conversely, that VHE observations of highly under-luminous AGNs could provide an important diagnostic tool for probing the conditions prevalent in the inner accretion disk of these sources."
1733033,"Twisted diagrams are ""diagrams"" with components in different categories. Structure maps are defined using auxiliary data which consists of functors relating the various categories to each other. Prime examples of the construction are spectra (in the sense of homotopy theory) and quasi-coherent sheaves on schemes. We develop the basic theory of twisted diagrams, and establish various model structures (which are well-known in special cases). We also introduce a notion of homotopy sheaves, a collection of local data which is compatible up to weak equivalence, and study basic properties of such objects. These objects occur in nature; for example, the notion of an Omega-spectrum fits into this framework. The main purpose of the paper is to provide a convenient reference for model structures on twisted diagrams, and for the language of sheaves and homotopy sheaves as defined here."
1733034,"We survey the extensions of a group by a group using crossed products instead of exact sequences of groups. The approach has various advantages, one of them being that the crossed product is an universal object. Several new applications are given, a general Schreier type theorem is proved and a few open problems are left."
1733035,"We study the space of conformal immersions of a 2-torus into the 4-sphere. The moduli space of generalized Darboux transforms of such an immersed torus has the structure of a Riemann surface, the spectral curve. This Riemann surface arises as the zero locus of the determinant of a holomorphic family of Dirac type operators parameterized over the complexified dual torus. The kernel line bundle of this family over the spectral curve describes the generalized Darboux transforms of the conformally immersed torus. If the spectral curve has finite genus the kernel bundle can be extended to the compactification of the spectral curve and we obtain a linear 2-torus worth of algebraic curves in projective 3-space. The original conformal immersion of the 2-torus is recovered as the orbit under this family of the point at infinity on the spectral curve projected to the 4-sphere via the twistor fibration."
1733036,"The spectrum of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is exactly derived in the thermodynamic limit by means of a spin-coherent-state formalism. In the first step, a classical analysis allows one to distinguish between four distinct regions in the parameter space according to the nature of the singularities arising in the classical energy surface; these correspond to spectral critical points. The eigenfunctions are then analyzed more precisely in terms of the associated roots of the Majorana polynomial, leading to exact expressions for the density of states in the thermodynamic limit. Finite-size effects are also analyzed, leading in particular to logarithmic corrections near the singularities occurring in the spectrum. Finally, we also compute expectation values of the spin operators in a semiclassical analysis in order to illustrate some subtle effects occurring in one region of the parameter space."
1733037,"The number N(E) of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function with positive imaginary part less than E is the sum of a ""smooth"" function N[over ](E) and a ""fluctuation."" Berry and Keating have shown that the asymptotic expansion of N[over ](E) counts states of positive energy less than E in a ""regularized"" semiclassical model with classical Hamiltonian H=xp. For a different regularization, Connes has shown that it counts states ""missing"" from a continuum. Here we show how the ""absorption spectrum"" model of Connes emerges as the lowest Landau level limit of a specific quantum-mechanical model for a charged particle on a planar surface in an electric potential and uniform magnetic field. We suggest a role for the higher Landau levels in the fluctuation part of N(E)."
1733038,"Essentially all undoped cuprates exhibit a quasiplanar, fourfold Cu-O coordination responsible for the magnetically active antibonding 3d(x(2)-y(2)) like state. Here, we present an electronic structure study for CuSb(2)O(6) that reveals, in contrast, a half-filled 3d(3z(2)-r(2)) orbital. This hitherto unobserved ground state originates from a competition of in- and out-of-plaquette orbitals where the strong Coulomb repulsion drives the surprising and unique orbital ordering. This, in turn, gives rise to an unexpected quasi-one-dimensional magnetic behavior. Our results provide a consistent explanation of recent thermodynamical and neutron diffraction measurements."
1733039,"The studies of the dynamics of topical dataflow of new information in the framework of a logistic model were suggested. The condition of topic balance, when the number of publications on all topics is proportional to the information space and time, was presented. General time dependence of the publication intensity in the Internet, devoted to particular topics, was observed; unlike an exponent model, it has a saturation area. Some limitations of a logistic model were identified opening the way for further research."
1733040,"We discuss aspects of antihydrogen studies, that relate to particle physics ideas and techniques, within the context of the ALPHA experiment at CERN's Antiproton Decelerator facility. We review the fundamental physics motivations for antihydrogen studies, and their potential physics reach. We argue that initial spectroscopy measurements, once antihydrogen is trapped, could provide competitive tests of CPT, possibly probing physics at the Planck Scale. We discuss some of the particle detection techniques used in ALPHA. Preliminary results from commissioning studies of a partial system of the ALPHA Si vertex detector are presented, the results of which highlight the power of annihilation vertex detection capability in antihydrogen studies."
1733041,"We study a specific class of deformations of curve singularities: the case when the singular point splits to several ones, such that the total δ invariant is preserved. These are also known as equi-normalizable or equi-generic deformations. We restrict primarily to the deformations of singularities with smooth branches. A natural invariant of the singular type is introduced: the dual graph. It imposes severe restrictions on the possible collisions/deformations. And allows to prove some bounds on the variation of classical invariants in equi-normalizable families. We consider in details deformations of ordinary multiple point, the deformations of a singularity into the collections of ordinary multiple points and deformations of the type x p + y pk into the collections of A k ’s."
1733042,"Bóna (2007) [6] studied the distribution of ascents, plateaux and descents in the class of Stirling permutations, introduced by Gessel and Stanley (1978) [13]. Recently, Janson (2008) [17] showed the connection between Stirling permutations and plane recursive trees and proved a joint normal law for the parameters considered by Bóna. Here we will consider generalized Stirling permutations extending the earlier results of Bóna (2007) [6] and Janson (2008) [17], and relate them with certain families of generalized plane recursive trees, and also (k+1)-ary increasing trees. We also give two different bijections between certain families of increasing trees, which both give as a special case a bijection between ternary increasing trees and plane recursive trees. In order to describe the (asymptotic) behaviour of the parameters of interests, we study three (generalized) Pólya urn models using various methods."
1733043,"One of the approaches to the solution of the navigation problem in current information flows is ranking the documents according to their popularity level. The definition of local and global news popularity which is based on the number of similar-in-content documents, published within local and global time interval, was suggested. Mutual behavior of the documents of local and global popularity levels was studied. The algorithm of detecting the documents which received great popularity before new topics appeared was suggested."
1733044,"We examine the response of closed-shell nuclei using a renormalized interaction, derived with the Unitary Correlation Operator Method (UCOM) from the Argonne V18 potential, and a second RPA (SRPA) method. The same two-body interaction is used to derive the Hartree–Fock ground state and the SRPA equations. Our results show that the coupling of particle–hole states to higher-order configurations produces sizable effects compared with first-order RPA. A much improved description of the isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole resonances is obtained, thanks in part to the more fundamental treatment of the nucleon effective mass offered by SRPA. The present work suggests the prospect of describing giant resonance properties realistically and consistently within SRPA or other extended RPA theories. Self-consistency issues of the present SRPA method and residual three-body effects are pointed out."
1733045,"Observations of thermal radiation from neutron stars allow one to measure the surface temperatures and confront them with cooling scenarios. Detection of gravitationally redshifted spectral lines can yield the mass-to-radius ratio. In the few cases when the distance is known, one can measure the neutron star radius, which is particularly important to constrain the equation of state of the superdense matter in the neutron star interiors. Finally, one can infer the chemical composition of the neutron star surface layers, which provides information about formation of neutron stars and their interaction with the environments. We present the observational results on thermal radiation from active pulsars and radio-quiet neutron stars, with emphasis on the results obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and discuss some implications of these results. In particular, we present a new interpretation of the thermal emission detected in the broad energy range (from optical to X-rays) from the puzzling object RX J1856.5-3754"
1733046,"We consider standard subordinacy theory for general Sturm--Liouville operators and give criteria when boundedness of solutions implies that no subordinate solutions exist. As applications, we prove a Weidmann-type result for general Sturm--Liouville operators and investigate the absolutely continuous spectrum of radially symmetric quantum trees."
1733048,"A consistent description of the {pi}{sup 0}{pi}{sup 0} invariant mass distribution in the {phi}(1020){yields}f{sub 0}(980){gamma}{yields}{pi}{sup 0}{pi}{sup 0}{gamma} decay and the {pi}{sup 0}{eta} in {phi}(1020){yields}a{sub 0}(980){gamma}{yields}{pi}{sup 0}{eta}{gamma} is suggested. A search for the consequences of the flavor SU(3) symmetry for the scalar mesons can be based on such an analysis. In order to accurately treat the pseudoscalar meson dynamics, which is very important for the scalar meson decays, we employ Resonance Chiral Theory."
1733049,"Let X be a quasi-compact scheme, equipped with an open covering by affine schemes U σ = Spec A σ . A quasi-coherent sheaf on X gives rise, by taking sections over the U σ , to a diagram of modules over the coordinate rings A σ , indexed by the intersection poset Σ of the covering. If X is a regular toric scheme over an arbitrary commutative ring, we prove that the unbounded derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on X can be obtained from a category of Σop-diagrams of chain complexes of modules by inverting maps which induce homology isomorphisms on hyper-derived inverse limits. Moreover, we show that there is a finite set of weak generators, one for each cone in the fan Σ. The approach taken uses the machinery of Bousfield–Hirschhorn colocalisation of model categories. The first step is to characterise colocal objects; these turn out to be homotopy sheaves in the sense that chain complexes over different open sets U σ agree on intersections up to quasi-isomorphism. In a second step it is shown that the homotopy category of homotopy sheaves is equivalent to the derived category of X."
1733050,"Recently Einstein's invariance of the phase of a plane wave (1905) has been described as ""questionable"" (Huang). Another definition of this phase, taking into account a ""relativistically induced optical anisotropy"" for isotropic medium in moving, has been proposed (Gjurkinovski). We suggest (logically) to determine this ""relativistically induced effect"" if the isotropic medium is the vacuum. We prove that the basic Lorentz invariant, in vacuum, is not the phase of a plane wave but the phase of a spherical wave. According to Poincare an isotropic spherical wave is not LTed (Lorentz transformed) into an isotropic spherical wave (Einstein 1905) but LTed into an anisotropic ellipsoidal wave (relativity of simultaneity). Poincare's ellipsoidal wavefront (1906) is an {equiphase} surface. The Lorenz gauge is connected with the invariance of the phase of a spherical wave and the transverse gauge with Einstein's invariant. We deduce from Poincare's invariant a relativistic Doppler formula which is unseparable from Poincare's theory of expansion of space and therefore the measurements of Hubble."
1733051,"We present 1D radiative transfer modelling of the envelopes of a sample of 18 low-mass protostars and pre-stellar cores with the aim of setting up realistic physical models, for use in a chemical description of the sources. The density and temperature profiles of the envelopes are constrained from their radial profiles obtained from SCUBA maps at 450 and 850 micron and from measurements of the source fluxes ranging from 60 micron to 1.3 mm. The densities of the envelopes within ~10000 AU can be described by single power-laws r^{-p} for the class 0 and I sources with p ranging from 1.3 to 1.9, with typical uncertainties of +/- 0.2. Four sources have flatter profiles, either due to asymmetries or to the presence of an outer constant density region. No significant difference is found between class 0 and I sources. The power-law fits fail for the pre-stellar cores, supporting recent results that such cores do not have a central source of heating. The derived physical models are used as input for Monte Carlo modelling of submillimeter C18O and C17O emission. It is found that class I objects typically show CO abundances close to those found in local molecular clouds, but that class 0 sources and pre-stellar cores show lower abundances by almost an order of magnitude implying that significant depletion occurs for the early phases of star formation. While the 2-1 and 3-2 isotopic lines can be fitted using a constant fractional CO abundance throughout the envelope, the 1-0 lines are significantly underestimated, possibly due to contribution of ambient molecular cloud material to the observed emission. The difference between the class 0 and I objects may be related to the properties of the CO ices. Comment: 21 pages, 12 figures, accepted by A&A"
1733052,"The vacuum energy density arising from the broken supersymmetry of the (standard-model) fields living on a brane cannot be fully ""off-loaded"" to the bulk: even assuming the existence of an effective ""self-tuning"" mechanism, a small fraction of the transferred energy ""bunces back"" to the brane, as a backreaction of the supersymmetry breaking gravitationally transmitted to the bulk. In that case the SUSY scale of the brane has to be bounded, to guarantee the consistency of such a residual energy density with current large-scale phenomonological constraints. This effect is illustrated by computing the zero-point energies of the tower of (higher-dimensional) massive states associated to tensor metric fluctuations on a brane embedded in a warped bulk geometry, and it is shown to be independent of the number of compact or non-compact extra dimensions.

1733054,"In this paper, we introduce the notion of $E$-Courant algebroids, where $E$ is a vector bundle. It is a kind of generalized Courant algebroid and contains Courant algebroids, Courant-Jacobi algebroids and omni-Lie algebroids as its special cases. We explore novel phenomena exhibited by $E$-Courant algebroids and provide many examples. We study the automorphism groups of omni-Lie algebroids and classify the isomorphism classes of exact $E$-Courant algebroids. In addition, we introduce the concepts of $E$-Lie bialgebroids and Manin triples."
1733055,"Interaction of traveling wave of classic light with 1D-chain of coupled quantum dots (QDs) in strong coupling regime has been theoretically considered. The effect of space propagation of Rabi oscillations in the form of traveling waves and wave packets has been predicted. Physical interpretation of the effect has been given, principles of its experimental observation are discussed."
1733056,"The absence of a band gap in graphene restricts its straightforward application as a channel material in field-effect transistors. In this letter, we report on a new approach to engineer a band gap in graphene field-effect devices (FEDs) by controlled structural modification of the graphene channel itself. The conductance in the FEDs is switched between a conductive ldquoon-staterdquo and an insulating ldquooff-staterdquo with more than six orders of magnitude difference in conductance. Above a critical value of an electric field applied to the FED gate under certain environmental conditions, a chemical modification takes place to form insulating graphene derivatives. The effect can be reversed by electrical fields of opposite polarity or short current pulses to recover the initial state. These reversible switches could potentially be applied to nonvolatile memories and novel neuromorphic processing concepts."
1733057,"It is demonstrated that SC mechanism of doped Fe-based compounds is characteristic for itinerant electron systems with coexistence of both (e-e)- and (e-h)-pairing arising due to electron-phonon and Coulomb interactions, respectively. The higher Tc of the SC transition here (as compared with conventional (LTSC) BCS-systems without (e-h)-pairing) is a natural consequence of (e-e)-pairing at the background of high density of states which arises in the narrow energy range near dielectric-(SDW)-gap (pseudogap) edges due to removing of electronic states from the energy region of dielectric (SDW) gap (pseudogap) (already formed at the part of the Fermi surface in the normal state with onset temperature T* (near the same for corresponding structural transition) due to (e-h)-pairing). Below Tc the system enters the coexistence (SC+SDW) state. The SDW formed is incommensurate with lattice and dynamic in character. The phase diagram for such system is determined: the doping dependence of the SC gap (and Tc) has a maximum (optimal doping) while the dielectric (SDW) gap (pseudogap) (and T*) is a decreasing function of doping. These conclusions follow from detailed analysis of available resistivity and another data for Fe-based superconductors on the basis of model with partial dielectrization of electron energy spectra. The picture obtained and manifestation of two order parameters (SC and SDW) in experiments, first of all, in threshold phenomena are discussed. The comparison with the case of cuprates is performed."
1733058,"We study the signature change in a perfect fluid Friedmann-Robertson-Walker quantum cosmological model. In this work the Schutz's variational formalism is applied to recover the notion of time. This gives rise to a Schrodinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation with arbitrary ordering for the scale factor. We use the eigenfunctions in order to construct wave packets and evaluate the time-dependent expectation value of the scale factor which coincides with the ontological interpretation. We show that these solutions exhibit signature transitions from a finite Euclidean to a Lorentzian domain. Moreover, such models are equivalent to a classical system where, besides the perfect fluid, a repulsive fluid is present."
1733059,"Let (W, S) be a Coxeter system, let S = I boolean OR J be a partition of S such that no element of I is conjugate to an element of J, let (J) over tilde be the set of W(1)-conjugates of elements of J, and let (W) over tilde be the subgroup of W generated by (J) over tilde. We show that W = (W) over tilde (sic) W(1) and that (J) over tilde is the canonical set of Coxeter generators of the reflection subgroup (W) over tilde of W. We also provide algebraic and geometric conditions for an external semidirect product of Coxeter groups to arise in this way, and explicitly describe all such decompositions of (irreducible) finite Coxeter groups and affine Weyl groups."
1733060,"The HI disk of the blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy NGC 2915 extends to 22 optical scalelengths and shows spiral arms reaching far beyond the optical component. None of the previous theories for spiral structure provide likely explanations for these very extended spiral arms. Our numerical simulations first demonstrate that such large spiral arms can form in an extended gas disk embedded in a massive triaxial dark matter halo with slow figure rotation, through the strong gravitational torque of the rotating halo. We then show that the detailed morphological properties of the developed spirals and rings depend strongly on the pattern speed of the figure rotation, the shape of the triaxial halo, and the inclination of the disk with respect to the plane including the triaxial halo's long and middle axes. These results strongly suggest that the dark matter halo of NGC 2915 is triaxial and has figure rotation. Based on these results, we also suggest that dynamical effects of triaxial halos with figure rotation are important in various aspect of galaxy formation and evolution, such as formation of polar ring galaxies, excitation of non-axisymmetric structures in low surface-brightness galaxies, and gas fueling to the central starburst regions of BCDs.

1733061,"Modeling dialog as a collaborative activity consists notably in specifying the content of the Conversational Common Ground and the kind of social mental state involved. In previous work (Saget, 2006), we claim that Collective Acceptance is the proper social attitude for modeling Conversational Common Ground in the particular case of goal-oriented dialog. In this paper, a formalization of Collective Acceptance is shown, besides elements in order to integrate this attitude in a rational model of dialog are provided; and finally, a model of referential acts as being part of a collaborative activity is presented. The particular case of reference has been chosen in order to exemplify our claims."
1733062,"Using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for an optomechanical system that leads to a nonlinear Kerr effect in the system's vacuum. The oscillating mirror at one edge of the optomechanical system induces a squeezing effect in the intensity spectrum of the cavity field. A near-resonant laser field is applied at the other edge to drive the cavity field, in order to enhance the Kerr effect. We also propose a quantum-nondemolition-measurement setup to monitor a system with two cavities separated by a common oscillating mirror, based on our effective Hamiltonian approach.

1733063,"The spin-one-half Falicov–Kimball model with spin-dependent on-site interaction between localized (f) and itinerant (d) electrons is studied by small-cluster exact-diagonalization calculations and a well-controlled approximative method in two dimensions. The results obtained are used to categorize the ground-state configurations according to common features (charge and spin ordering) for all f - and d -electron concentrations (nf and nd) on finite square lattices. It is shown that only a few configuration types form the basic structure of the charge phase diagram in the nf–nd plane. In particular, the largest regions of stability correspond to the phase segregated configurations, the axial striped configurations and configurations that can be considered as mixtures of chessboard configurations and the full (empty) lattice. Since the magnetic phase diagram is much richer than the charge phase diagram, the magnetic superstructures are examined only at selected values of f - and d -electron concentrations.

1733064,"We compute the luminosity function (LF) and the formation rate of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) by fitting the observed differential peak flux distribution obtained by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) in two different scenarios: (i) the GRB luminosity evolves with redshift and (ii) GRBs form preferentially in low-metallicity environments. In both cases, model predictions are consistent with the Swift number counts and with the number of detections at z > 2.5 and >3.5. To discriminate between the two evolutionary scenarios, we compare the model results with the number of luminous bursts (i.e. with isotropic peak luminosity in excess of 1053 erg s−1) detected by Swift in its first 3 yr of mission. Our sample conservatively contains only bursts with good redshift determination and measured peak energy. We find that pure luminosity evolution models can account for the number of sure identifications. In the case of a pure density evolution scenario, models with Zth > 0.3 Z⊙ are ruled out with high confidence. For lower metallicity thresholds, the model results are still statistically consistent with available lower limits. However, many factors can increase the discrepancy between model results and data, indicating that some luminosity evolution in the GRB LF may be needed also for such low values of Zth. Finally, using these new constraints, we derive robust upper limits on the bright end of the GRB LF, showing that this cannot be steeper than ∼2.6."
1733065,"By means of high-resolution angle resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) we have studied the fermiology of 2H transition metal dichalcogenide polytypes TaSe2, NbSe2, and Cu0.2NbS2. The tight-binding model of the electronic structure, extracted from ARPES spectra for all three compounds, was used to calculate the Lindhard function (bare spin susceptibility), which reflects the propensity to charge density wave (CDW) instabilities observed in TaSe2 and NbSe2. We show that though the Fermi surfaces of all three compounds possess an incommensurate nesting vector in the close vicinity of the CDW wave vector, the nesting and ordering wave vectors do not exactly coincide, and there is no direct relationship between the magnitude of the susceptibility at the nesting vector and the CDW transition temperature. The nesting vector persists across the incommensurate CDW transition in TaSe2 as a function of temperature despite the observable variations of the Fermi surface geometry in this temperature range. In Cu0.2NbS2 the nesting vector is present despite different doping level, which lets us expect a possible enhancement of the CDW instability with Cu-intercalation in the CuxNbS2 family of materials."
1733066,"We consider the model of random interlacements on Z^d introduced in [8]. For this model, we prove the uniqueness of the infinite component of the vacant set. As a consequence, we derive the continuity in u of the probability that the origin belongs to the infinite component of the vacant set at level u in the supercritical phase u < u_*."
1733067,"We introduce a decentralized replication strategy for peer-to-peer file exchange based on exhaustive exploration of the neighborhood of any node in the network. The replication scheme lets the replicas evenly populate the network mesh, while regulating the total number of replicas at the same time. This is achieved by self adaptation to entering or leaving of nodes. Exhaustive exploration is achieved by a spiral walk algorithm that generates a number of messages linearly proportional to the number of visited nodes. It requires a dedicated topology (a triangular mesh on a closed surface). We introduce protocols for node connection and departure that maintain the triangular mesh at low computational and bandwidth cost. Search efficiency is increased using a mechanism based on dynamically allocated super peers. We conclude with a discussion on experimental validation results."
1733068,"Longitudinal ternary and binary fission barriers of $^{36}$Ar, $^{56}$Ni and $^{252}$Cf nuclei have been determined within a rotational liquid drop model taking into account the nuclear proximity energy.

1733069,"Two wire mesh tomography devices and a liquid collector were used to study the influence of the gas flow rate on liquid distribution when fluids distribution on top of the reactor is ensured by a perforated plate. In opposition to most of the studies realized by other authors, conditions in which the gas has a negative impact in liquid distribution were evidenced. Indeed, the obtained results show that the influence of gas flow rate depends on the quality of the initial distribution, as the gas forces the liquid to ""respect"" the distribution imposed at the top of the reactor. Finally, a comparison between the two measuring techniques shows the limitations of the liquid collector and the improper conclusions to which its use could lead."
1733070,"Deep inelastic scattering off the strongly coupled N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma at finite temperature can be computed within the AdS/CFT correspondence, with results which are suggestive of a parton picture for the plasma. Via successive branchings, essentially all partons cascade down to very small values of the longitudinal momentum fraction x and to transverse momenta smaller than the saturation momentum Q_s\sim T/x. This scale Q_s controls the plasma interactions with a hard probe, in particular, the jet energy loss and its transverse momentum broadening."
1733071,"We report on time-resolved CCD photometry of the cataclysmic variable EG Aquarii during a 2006 November outburst. During the outburst, superhumps were unambiguously detected with a mean period of 0.078828(6) d, allowing for the first time to classify the object as an SU UMa-type dwarf nova. It also turned out that the outburst contained a precursor. At the end of the precursor, immature profiles of humps were observed. By a phase analysis of these humps, we interpreted the features as being superhumps. This is the second example that the superhumps were shown during a precursor. Near the maximum stage of the outburst, we discovered an abrupt shift of the superhump period by ${\sim\;}$0.002 d. After the supermaximum, the superhump period decreased at a rate of $\dot{P}/P =$ $-$8.2${\;\times\;}$10$^{-5}$, which is typical for SU UMa-type dwarf novae. Although the outburst light curve was characteristic of SU UMa-type dwarf novae, long-term monitoring of the variable shows no outbursts over the past decade. We also comment on the basic properties of long period and inactive SU UMa-type dwarf novae."
1733072,"Motivated, in part, by the desire to develop an information-theoretic foundation for compound Poisson approximation limit theorems (analogous to the corresponding developments for the central limit theorem and for simple Poisson approximation), this work examines sufficient conditions under which the compound Poisson distribution has maximal entropy within a natural class of probability measures on the nonnegative integers. We show that the natural analog of the Poisson maximum entropy property remains valid if the measures under consideration are log-concave, but that it fails in general. A parallel maximum entropy result is established for the family of compound binomial measures. The proofs are largely based on ideas related to the semigroup approach introduced in recent work by Johnson for the Poisson family. Sufficient conditions are given for compound distributions to be log-concave, and specific examples are presented illustrating all the above results."
1733073,"Accelerating Chaplygin gas combined with the decelerating braneworld Dvali–Gabadadze–Porrati (DGP) model can produce an overall accelerated expansion of the order of magnitude seen. Both models have similar asymptotic properties at early and late cosmic times, and are characterized by a length scale. Taking the length scales to be proportional one obtains a combined model with three free parameters, one more than the ΛCDM model, which fits supernovae data equally well. We further constrain it by the CMB shift parameter, and by requiring that the model yields a longer age of the Universe than that of the oldest star HE 1523-0901, t∗=13.4±0.8(stat)±1.8(syst). In contrast to generalized DGP and Chaplygin gas models, this is a genuine alternative to the cosmological constant model because it does not reduce to it in any limit of the parameter space."

E T production with centrality and $\sqrt {s_{NN} } $ is studied with similar measurements from SPS to RHIC and is compared with a final state gluon saturation model (EKRT). The most striking feature is the observation of a nearly constant value of E T /N ch ∼ 0.8 GeV from AGS, SPS to RHIC. The initial energy density estimated by the boost-invariant Bjorken hydrodynamic model, is well above the critical density for a deconfined matter of quarks and gluons predicted by lattice QCD calculations."
1733076,"In this paper by using the method of point canonical transformation we find that the Coulomb and Kratzer potentials can be mapped to the Morse potential. Then we show that the Pöschl-Teller potential type I belongs to the same subclass of shape invariant potentials as Hulthén potential. Also we show that the shape-invariant algebra for Coulomb, Kratzer, and Morse potentials is SU(1,1), while the shape-invariant algebra for Pöschl-Teller typeI and Hulthén is SU(2)."
1733077,"We explore the dependence of the double ionization of the He atom on the frequency of a strong laser field while keeping the ponderomotive energy constant. As we increase the frequency we find that the remarkable ""finger-like"" structure for high momenta recently found for $\omega=0.055$ a.u. \cite{Staudte, Rudenko} persists for higher frequencies. At the same time, at $\omega=0.187$ a.u. a new X-shape structure emerges for small momenta that prevails in the correlated momenta distribution. The role of this structure as a signature of the frequency dependence of non-sequential double ionization is discussed."
1733078,"We use functional Bethe Ansatz equations to calculate the cumulants of the total current in the partially asymmetric exclusion process. We recover known formulas for the first two cumulants (mean value of the current and diffusion constant) and obtain an explicit finite size formula for the third cumulant. The expression for the third cumulant takes a simple integral form in the limit where the asymmetry scales as the inverse of the square root of the size of the system, which corresponds to a natural separation between weak and strong asymmetry."

1733080,"Determining the number of embeddings of Laman graph frameworks is an open problem which corresponds to understanding the solutions of the resulting systems of equations. In this paper we investigate the bounds which can be obtained from the viewpoint of Bernstein's Theorem.

While in most cases the resulting bounds are weaker than the best known bounds on the number of embeddings, for some classes of graphs the bounds are tight."
1733081,"Arguments coming from Quantum Field Theory are supplemented with a 1-loop perturbative calculation to settle the non-unitarity of mixing matrices linking renormalized mass eigenstates to bare flavor states for non-degenerate coupled fermions. We simultaneously diagonalize the kinetic and mass terms and counterterms in the renormalized Lagrangian. SU(2)_L gauge invariance constrains the mixing matrix in charged currents of renormalized mass states, for example the Cabibbo matrix, to stay unitary. Leaving aside CP violation, we observe that the mixing angles exhibit, within experimental uncertainty, a very simple breaking pattern of SU(2)_f horizontal symmetry linked to the algebra of weak neutral currents, the origin of which presumably lies beyond the Standard Model. It concerns: on one hand, the three quark mixing angles; on the other hand, a neutrino-like pattern in which theta_{23} is maximal and tan(2 theta_{12})=2. The Cabibbo angle fulfills the condition tan (2 theta_c)=1/2 and theta_{12} for neutrinos satisfies accordingly the ""quark-lepton complementarity condition"" theta_c + theta_{12}= \pi/4. theta_{13} = +- 5.7 10^{-3} are the only values obtained for the third neutrino mixing angle that lie within present experimental bounds. Flavor symmetries, their breaking by a non-degenerate mass spectrum, and their entanglement with the gauge symmetry, are scrutinized; the special role of flavor rotations as a very mildly brokensymmetry of the Standard Model is outlined.

1733082,"A recent re-analysis of Whole Earth Telescope observations of GD 358 obtained in 1990 suggests that asteroseismology of additional DBV white dwarfs can lead to independent constraints on the important, but poorly determined, ^{12}C(alpha,gamma)^{16}O nuclear reaction rate. Data exist for several other DBV white dwarfs, but relatively few modes are detected and there is often no multiplet structure to aid in the identification of the spherical harmonic indices (l,m). I use a new grid of one million DBV models covering a broad range of masses, temperatures, and surface helium layer masses to investigate the consequences of assuming m=0 for global model-fitting. I find that when the spherical degree is known and the rotation period is of order 1 day, the model-fitting procedure applied to modes with unknown m-values will still correctly identify the_families_ of possible solutions, and has a high probability of identifying the same globally optimal solution found when the m-value is known."

We show that the sharp loss of derivatives for such an operator to be bounded on these spaces is related to the rank $r$ of the Hessian of the phase $\Phi(x,\eta)$ with respect to the space variables $x$. Indeed, we show that operators of order $m=-r|1/2-1/p|$ are bounded on $(\mathcal{F}L^p)_{comp}$, if the mapping $x\longmapsto\nabla_x\Phi(x,\eta)$ is constant on the fibers, of codimension $r$, of an affine fibration."
1733084,"We report on two XMM-Newton observations performed in 2006 of the luminous low-mass X-ray binary XB1832-330 which is located in the galactic globular cluster NGC 6652 and is probably an ultracompact binary (orbital period less than 1 hour). The aim of these observations is to investigate the low-energy absorption towards NGC6652 and in particular to search for Ne-rich material local to the binary, which has been suggested as a possible spectral signature of Neon rich degenerate companions. XMM-Newton observed the source twice, in 2006 September and October. High resolution spectroscopy with the RGS was used to estimate the ratio of the neutral neon to oxygen column densities to search for an anomalous Ne abundance in this X-ray binary. We find no evidence for anomalous Ne/O ratios, finding Ne/O=0.18+/-0.06 and Ne/O=0.17+/-0.03 (1 sigma uncertainties), in the two observations, respectively. These values are consistent with that in the interstellar medium. Timing analysis of EPIC data suggests possible periodicities at 9170+/-235 s and 18616 +/- 531 s, which need confirmation. A by-product of these observations consists of the spatial analysis of the source field, which resulted in the detection of 46 faint sources within the EPIC field of view, which are not present in the Second XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue. All these faint sources are likely foreground objects. We performed the first high spectral resolution observations of XB1832-33, a probable ultracompact binary, without finding any evidence for an anomalous Ne abundance.

More precisely, given a collection of linear spaces in $\PP^n$ we study the existence of rational normal curves intersecting each component of the configuration maximally. We introduce different methods to show existence and non-existence of such curves. We also show how to apply these techniques to the study of defectivity of Segre-Veronese varieties."
1733087,"In this paper, based on a weighted projection of a bipartite user-object network, we introduce a personalized recommendation algorithm, called network-based inference (NBI), which has higher accuracy than the classical algorithm, namely collaborative filtering. In NBI, the correlation resulting from a specific attribute may be repeatedly counted in the cumulative recommendations from different objects. By considering the higher order correlations, we design an improved algorithm that can, to some extent, eliminate the redundant correlations. We test our algorithm on two benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Netflix. Compared with NBI, the algorithmic accuracy, measured by the ranking score, can be further improved by 23 per cent for MovieLens and 22 per cent for Netflix. The present algorithm can even outperform the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm, which requires much longer computational time. Furthermore, most previous studies considered the algorithmic accuracy only; in this paper, we argue that the diversity and popularity, as two significant criteria of algorithmic performance, should also be taken into account. With more or less the same accuracy, an algorithm giving higher diversity and lower popularity is more favorable. Numerical results show that the present algorithm can outperform the standard one simultaneously in all five adopted metrics: lower ranking score and higher precision for accuracy, larger Hamming distance and lower intra-similarity for diversity, as well as smaller average degree for popularity."
1733088,"For each $n \geq 1$, let $\{X_{j,n}\}_{1 \leq j \leq n}$ be a sequence of strictly stationary random variables. In this article, we give some asymptotic weak dependence conditions for the convergence in distribution of the point process $N_n=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\delta_{X_{j,n}}$ to an infinitely divisible point process. From the point process convergence, we obtain the convergence in distribution of the partial sum sequence $S_n=\sum_{j=1}^{n}X_{j,n}$ to an infinitely divisible random variable, whose L\'{e}vy measure is related to the canonical measure of the limiting point process. As examples, we discuss the case of triangular arrays which possess known (row-wise) dependence structures, like the strong mixing property, the association, or the dependence structure of a stochastic volatility model."

The theory explains the remnant Fermi surface for the undoped compunds, as well as hole pockets, Fermi arcs, high energy pseudogap and the the mid-infrared band in doped materials. Destructive interference between the phases of a photohole near $\Gamma$ and the internal phases of the Zhang Rice singlet combined with our theory moreover explains the `waterfall' phenomenon.

1733090,"We investigate the dynamics defined by the following set of three coupled first-order ODEs: It is shown that the system can be reduced to quadratures which can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. Despite the integrable character of the model, the general solution is a multiple-valued function of time (considered as a complex variable), and we investigate the position and nature of its branch points. In the semi-symmetric case (g1 = g2 ≠ g3), for rational values of the coupling constants the system is isochronous and explicit formulae for the period of the solutions can be given. For irrational values, the motions are confined but feature aperiodic motion with sensitive dependence on initial conditions. The system shows a rich dynamical behaviour that can be understood in quantitative detail since a global description of the Riemann surface associated with the solutions can be achieved. The details of the description of the Riemann surface are postponed to a forthcoming publication. This toy model is meant to provide a paradigmatic first step towards understanding a certain novel kind of chaotic behaviour."
1733091,"The relative power of actions and disarrangements in a Cauchy body suffering mutations due to defect evolution is introduced. It is shown that its invariance under the action of the Euclidean group over the ambient space and the material space gives rise to both standard and configurational balances. The procedure allows one to avoid the use of the inverse motion and the postulate of independent configurational balances governing the evolution of bulk defects. The identification of the configurational actions (at least in their purely mechanical parts) follows naturally without using the mechanical dissipation inequality and, above all, without rendering explicit the list of constitutive entries of the energy. Such actions satisfy balance laws that correspond to Killing fields of the metric in the material (referential) configuration."
1733092,"In the random graph $G(n,p)$ with $pn$ bounded, the degrees of the vertices are almost i.i.d Poisson random variables with mean $\gl:= p(n-1)$. Motivated by this fact, we introduce the Poisson cloning model $G_{PC} (n,p)$ for random graphs in which the degrees are i.i.d Poisson random variables with mean $\gl$. Then, we first establish a theorem that shows the new model is equivalent to the classical model $G(n,p)$ in an asymptotic sense. Next, we introduce a useful algorithm, called the cut-off line algorithm, to generate the random graph $G_{PC} (n,p)$. The Poisson cloning model $G_{PC}(n,p)$ equipped with the cut-off line algorithm enables us to very precisely analyze the sizes of the largest component and the $t$-core of $G(n,p)$. This new approach to the problems yields not only elegant proofs but also improved bounds that are essentially best possible. We also consider the Poisson cloning models for random hypergraphs and random $k$-SAT problems. Then, the $t$-core problem for random hypergraphs and the pure literal algorithm for random $k$-SAT problems are analyzed."
1733093,"Peer-to-peer networks consist of thousands or millions of nodes that might join and leave arbitrarily. The evaluation of new protocols in real environments is many times practically impossible, especially at design and testing stages. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation aspects of a new Java based P2P simulator that has been developed to support scalability in the evaluation of such P2P dynamic environments. Evolving the functionality presented by previous solutions, we provide a friendly graphical user interface through which the high-level theoretic researcher/designer of a P2P system can easily construct an overlay with the desirable number of nodes and evaluate its operations using a number of key distributions. Furthermore, the simulator has built-in ability to produce statistics about the distributed structure. Emphasis was given to the parametrical configuration of the simulator. As a result the developed tool can be utilized in the simulation and evaluation procedures of a variety of different protocols, with only few changes in the Java code."

1733095,"The surprising discovery of an accelerating universe led cosmologists to posit the existence of ""dark energy""--a mysterious energy field that permeates the universe. Understanding dark energy has become the central problem of modern cosmology. After describing the scientific background in depth, we formulate the task as a nonlinear inverse problem that expresses the comoving distance function in terms of the dark-energy equation of state. We present two classes of methods for making sharp statistical inferences about the equation of state from observations of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe). First, we derive a technique for testing hypotheses about the equation of state that requires no assumptions about its form and can distinguish among competing theories. Second, we present a framework for computing parametric and nonparametric estimators of the equation of state, with an associated assessment of uncertainty. Using our approach, we evaluate the strength of statistical evidence for various competing models of dark energy. Consistent with current studies, we find that with the available Type Ia SNe data, it is not possible to distinguish statistically among popular dark-energy models, and that, in particular, there is no support in the data for rejecting a cosmological constant. With much more supernova data likely to be available in coming years (e.g., from the DOE/NASA Joint Dark Energy Mission), we address the more interesting question of whether future data sets will have sufficient resolution to distinguish among competing theories.

1733096,"The subject area referred to as 'wave chaos', 'quantum chaos' or 'quantum chaology' has been investigated mostly by the theoretical physics community in the last 30 years. The questions it raises have more recently also attracted the attention of mathematicians and mathematical physicists, due to connections with number theory, graph theory, Riemannian, hyperbolic or complex geometry, classical dynamical systems, probability, etc. After giving a rough account on 'what is quantum chaos?', I intend to list some pending questions, some of them having been raised a long time ago, some others more recent.

1733099,We show that if a compact Kahler manifold X admits a cohomologically hyperbolic surjective endomorphism then its Kodaira dimension is non-positive. This gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Guedj in the holomorphic case. The main part of the paper is to determine the geometric structure and the fundamental groups (up to finite index) for those X of dimension 3.
1733100,"We consider the problem of reliably finding filaments in point clouds. Realistic data sets often have numerous filaments of various sizes and shapes. Statistical techniques exist for finding one (or a few) filaments but these methods do not handle noisy data sets with many filaments. Other methods can be found in the astronomy literature but they do not have rigorous statistical guarantees. We propose the following method. Starting at each data point we construct the steepest ascent path along a kernel density estimator. We locate filaments by finding regions where these paths are highly concentrated. Formally, we define the density of these paths and we construct a consistent estimator of this path density.

1733101,"Scattering of backward volume magnetostatic spin waves from a one-dimensional magnonic crystal, realized by a grating of shallow grooves etched into the surface of an yttrium-iron garnet film, was experimentally studied. Rejection frequency bands were clearly observed. The rejection efficiency and the frequency width of the rejection bands increase with increasing groove depth. A theoretical model based on the analogy of a spin-wave film-waveguide with a microwave transmission line was used to interpret the obtained experimental results."
1733102,"We investigate mesoscopic fluctuations in the spin polarization generated by a static electric field and by Rashba spin-orbit interaction in a disordered 2D electron gas. In a diagrammatic approach we find that the out-of-plane polarization--while being zero for self-averaging systems--exhibits large sample-to-sample fluctuations which are shown to be well within experimental reach. We evaluate the disorder-averaged variance of the susceptibility and find its dependence on magnetic field, spin-orbit interaction, dephasing, and chemical potential difference."

1733106,"We propose to design data structures called succinct geometric indexes of negligible space (more precisely, o(n) bits) that, by taking advantage of the n points in the data set permuted and stored elsewhere as a sequence, to support geometric queries in optimal time. Our first and main result is a succinct geometric index that can answer point location queries, a fundamental problem in computational geometry, on planar triangulations in O(lg n) time. We also design three variants of this index. The first supports point location using $\lg n + 2\sqrt{\lg n} + O(\lg^{1/4} n)$ point-line comparisons. The second supports point location in o(lg n) time when the coordinates are integers bounded by U. The last variant can answer point location in O(H+1) expected time, where H is the entropy of the query distribution. These results match the query efficiency of previous point location structures that use O(n) words or O(n lg n) bits, while saving drastic amounts of space. We then generalize our succinct geometric index to planar subdivisions, and design indexes for other types of queries. Finally, we apply our techniques to design the first implicit data structures that support point location in $O(\lg^2 n)$ time."
1733107,"We study the loci of principally polarized abelian varieties with points of high multiplicity on the theta divisor. Using the heat equation and degeneration techniques, we relate these loci and their closures to each other, as well as to the singular set of the universal theta divisor. We obtain bounds on the dimensions of these loci and relations among their dimensions, and make further conjectures about their structure."
1733108,"We study quantum correlations and complexity of simulation, characterized by quantum mutual information and entanglement entropy in operator space respectively, for thermal states in critical, non-critical and quantum chaotic spin chains. A simple general relation between the two quantities is proposed. We show that in all cases mutual information and entanglement entropy saturate with the system size, whereas as a function of the inverse temperature, we find logarithmic divergences for critical cases and uniform bounds in non-critical cases. A simple efficient quasi-exact method for computation of arbitrary entropy related quantities in thermalized XY spin chains is proposed."

In the stationary limit, the coherences between eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the occupations, meaning that the stationary density matrix is approximately diagonal in the energy representation. A weakly distorted grand canonical Gibbs distribution fits well the occupations."
1733110,"In this paper we derive an expression for the dynamic electric polarizability of a particle bound by a double delta potential for frequencies below and above the absolute value of the particle's ground state energy.

In addition we derive a general expression of the dynamic electric polarizability for a potential of multi-delta functions. Comment: 11 pages, 5 figures"
1733111,"We use a volume- and flux-limited sample of local (0.03 ≤z≤ 0.1) radio galaxies with optical counterparts to address the question of how long a typical galaxy spends in radio active and quiescent states. The length of the active phase has a strong dependence on the stellar mass of the host galaxy. Radio sources in the most massive hosts are also retriggered more frequently. The time spent in the active phase has the same dependence on stellar mass as does the gas cooling rate, suggesting the onset of the quiescent phase is due to fuel depletion. We find radio and emission-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity to be independent, consistent with these corresponding to different accretion states."
1733112,"Clear signs of excess dileptons above the known sources were found at the SPS over past years. However, a real clarification of these observations was only recently achieved by NA60, measuring dimuons with unprecedented precision in 158A GeV In–In collisions. The excess mass spectrum in the region M< 1 GeV is consistent with a dominant contribution from π+π− → ρ → μ+μ− annihilation. The associated ρ spectral function shows a strong broadening, but essentially no shift in mass. In the region M> 1 GeV, the excess is found to be prompt, not due to enhanced charm production. The inverse slope parameter Teff associated with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to ρ, followed by a sudden decline above. While the initial rise, coupled to a hierarchy in hadron freeze-out, points to the radial flow of a hadronic decay source, the decline above signals a transition to a low-flow source, presumably of partonic origin. The mass spectra show at low transverse momenta the steep rise toward low masses, characteristic for Planck-like radiation. The polarization of the excess referred to the Collins Soper frame is found to be isotropic. All observations are consistent with the interpretation of the excess as thermal radiation."
1733113,"We consider the correlation structure of the random coefficients for a class of wavelet systems on the sphere (labelled Mexican needlets) which was recently introduced in the literature by [D. Geller, A. Mayeli, Nearly tight frames and space-frequency analysis on compact manifolds, Preprint, 2007. arxiv:0706.3642v2]. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for these coefficients to be asymptotically uncorrelated in the real and in the frequency domain. Here, the asymptotic theory is developed in the high frequency sense. Statistical applications are also discussed, in particular with reference to the analysis of cosmological data."
1733114,"Neutrino lines from very long lived nuclei in simple crystals such as metals have hypersharp natural width, motionally narrowed by lattice vibrations in analogy to recoilless emission. A generalized hypersharp line fraction including the recoilless part can be derived in a frequency modulation approach. The nue lines of natural width in 3H to 3He 2-body beta-decay can then be resonantly captured with geometrical cross section. The extreme sharpness DeltaE/E~10-29 of the tritium nue line can probe the Planck length L via its limits on the widths of states, DeltaE/E(L) =L(L/R)beta =10-20(beta ~1) to 10-40 (beta= L/R(fm)). Stringent limits can be set on beta, thus, on models of quantum gravity."
1733115,We analyze the details of mass exchange in the vicinity of the Coulomb barrier for heavy-ion collisions involving neutron-rich nuclei using the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. We discuss the time-dependence of transfer and show that the potential barriers seen by individual single-particle states can be considerably different than the effective barrier for the two interacting nuclei having a single center-of-mass. For this reason we observe a substantial transfer probability even at energies below the effective barrier.

1733117,Measured response functions and low photon yield spectra of silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) were compared to multi-photoelectron pulse-height distributions generated by a Monte Carlo model. Characteristic parameters for SiPM were derived. The devices were irradiated with 14 MeV electrons at the Mainz microtron MAMI. It is shown that the first noticeable damage consists of an increase in the rate of dark pulses and the loss of uniformity in the pixel gains. Higher radiation doses also reduced the photon detection efficiency. The results are especially relevant for applications of SiPM in fibre detectors at high luminosity experiments.
1733118,"We analyze the generation of helical magnetic fields during preheating in a model of low-scale electroweak (EW) hybrid inflation. We show how the inhomogeneities in the Higgs field, resulting from tachyonic preheating after inflation, seed the magnetic fields in a way analogous to that predicted by Vachaspati and Cornwall in the context of the EW symmetry breaking. At this stage, the helical nature of the generated magnetic fields is linked to the non-trivial winding of the Higgs-field. We analyze non-perturbatively the evolution of these helical seeds through the highly non-linear stages of symmetry breaking (SB) and beyond. Electroweak SB occurs via the nucleation and growth of Higgs bubbles which squeeze the magnetic fields into string-like structures. The W-boson charge density clusters in lumps around the magnetic strings. After symmetry breaking, a detailed analysis of the magnetic field Fourier spectrum shows two well differentiated components: a UV radiation tail at a temperature T ∼ 0.23m H, slowly growing with time, and an IR peak associated to the helical magnetic fields, which seems to follow inverse cascade. The system enters a regime in which we observe that both the amplitude (ρ B/ρ EW ∼ 10 -2) and the correlation length of the magnetic field grow linearly with time. During this stage of evolution we also observe a power-law growth in the helical susceptibility. These properties support the possibility that our scenario could provide the seeds eventually evolving into the microgauss fields observed today in galaxies and clusters of galaxies."
1733119,"Using the linearity property of the Mullins-Herring equation when the velocity is zero with a Gaussian noise, we obtain an analytic form for the global mean-square surface width and height-height correlation function.

We measure the computational performance as a function of number of processors and problem size to determine the scaling performance of the raytracing calculation on the Blue Gene. We find nontrivial scaling behavior at large number of processors. We discuss applications of this technology to scientific visualization with advanced lighting and high resolution. We utilize three racks of a Blue Gene/L in our calculations which is less than three percent of the the capacity of the worlds largest Blue Gene computer.

1733124,"The example of disk galaxy rotation curves is given for inferring dark matter from redundant computational procedure because proper care of astrophysical and computational context was not taken. At least three attempts that take the context into account have not found adequate voice because of haste in wrongly concluding existence of dark matter on the part of even experts. This firmly entrenched view, prevalent for about 3/4ths of a century, has now become difficult to correct. The right context must be borne in mind at every step to avoid such a situation. Perhaps other examples exist. Keywords: dark matter; disk galaxy; rotation curve; context-awareness. Topics: Algorithms; Applications."
1733125,"An efficient multi-mode quantum memory is a crucial resource for long-distance quantum communication based on quantum repeaters. We propose a quantum memory based on spectral shaping of an inhomogeneously broadened optical transition into an atomic frequency comb (AFC). The spectral width of the AFC allows efficient storage of multiple temporal modes, without the need to increase the absorption depth of the storage material, in contrast to previously known quantum memories. Efficient readout is possible thanks to rephasing of the atomic dipoles due to the AFC structure. Long-time storage and on-demand readout is achieved by use of spin-states in a lambda-type configuration. We show that an AFC quantum memory realized in solids doped with rare-earth-metal ions could store hundreds of modes or more with close to unit efficiency, for material parameters achievable today."
1733126,"Method of multiple internal reflections (method MIR) in description of $\alpha$-decay of nucleus in the spherically symmetric approximation is presented in paper. In approach MIR the formalism of calculation of amplitudes of wave function, described moving of $\alpha$-particle from the internal region outside with its tunneling through a realistic radial $\alpha$-nucleus barrier of arbitrary shape, has been constructed at first time. The method MIR gives convergent values for the amplitudes of transmission and reflection, coefficients of penetrability and reflection, obtained in description of leaving of the $\alpha$-particle relatively a potential with barrier in form of a number of rectangular steps (multi-steps potential), with tending this potential to the realistic $\alpha$-nucleus one, and limit values of the amplitudes and coefficients are considered as exact concerning the realistic $\alpha$-nucleus potential (without application of WKB approximation). In approach MIR a dependence of the penetrability coefficient and half-live on the location of the starting point, from where $\alpha$-particle begins to move outside, is opened. From here, we define a radial coordinate of the most probable formation of the $\alpha$-particle inside nucleus before its $\alpha$-decay as such starting point, at moving of the $\alpha$-particle from which outside the half-live, calculated by approach MIR, is maximally closed to its experimental value. For isotopes ${\rm Po}$ with different mass number $A$ we have obtained essentially closer values for half-live, calculated by such approach, to their experimental values in a comparison with half-lives obtained by approach WKB. This result is stable for all studied nuclei. Comment: 25 pages, 9 file of figure in EPS format"
1733127,"We present spatially-resolved, rest-frame optical spectroscopy of a z~3 Lyman-break galaxy (LBG), Q0347-383 C5, obtained with SINFONI on the VLT. This galaxy, among the ~10% brightest LBGs, is only the second z~3 LBG observed with an integral-field spectrograph. It was first described by Pettini et al. (2001), who obtained WFPC2 F702W imaging and longslit spectroscopy in the K-band. We find that the emission line morphology is dominated by two unresolved blobs at a projected distance of ~5 kpc with a velocity offset of ~33 km s^-1. Velocity dispersions suggest that each blob has a mass of ~10^10 M_sun. Unlike Pettini et al. (2001), our spectra are deep enough to detect H-beta, and we derive star-formation rates of ~20-40 M_sun yr^-1, and use the H-beta/[OIII] ratio to crudely estimate an oxygen abundance 12+[O/H]=7.9-8.6, which is in the range typically observed for LBGs. We compare the properties of Q0347-383 C5 with what is found for other LBGs, including the gravitationally lensed ``arc+core'' galaxy (Nesvadba et al. 2006), and discuss possible scenarios for the nature of the source, namely disk rotation, a starburst-driven wind, disk fragmentation, and merging of two LBGs. We favor the merging interpretation or bright, extended LBGs like Q0347-383C5, in broad agreement with predicted merger rates from hierarchical models. Comment: A&A accepted"
1733128,"Charge ordering with structural distortion in quasi-two-dimensional organic conductors θ-(ET)2RbZn(SCN)4 (ET = BEDT-TTF) and α-(ET)2I3 is investigated theoretically. By using the Hartree-Fock approximation for an extended Hubbard model which includes both on-site and intersite Coulomb interactions together with Peierls-type electron-lattice couplings, we examine the role of lattice degrees of freedom on charge order. It is found that the experimentally observed, horizontal charge order is stabilized by lattice distortion in both compounds. In particular, the lattice effect is crucial to the realization of the charge order in θ-(ET)2RbZn(SCN)4, while the peculiar band structure whose symmetry is lower than that of θ-(ET)2RbZn(SCN)4 in the metallic phase is also an important factor in α-(ET)2I3 together with the lattice distortion. For α-(ET)2I3, we obtain a phase transition from a charge-disproportionated metallic phase to the horizontal charge order with lattice modulations, which is consistent with the latest X-ray experimental result."
1733129,"We present an example of a complete and minimal Gabor system consisting of time-frequency shifts of a Gaussian, localized at the coordinate axes in the time-frequency plane (phase space). Asymptotically, the number of time-frequency shifts contained in a disk centered at the origin is only 2/pi times the number of points from the von Neumann lattice found in the same disk. Requiring a certain regular distribution in phase space, we show that our system has minimal density among all complete and minimal systems of time-frequency shifts of a Gaussian."
1733131,"Within the Relativistic Theory of Gravitation it is shown that the equation of state $p=\rho$ holds near the center of a black hole. For the stiff equation of state $p=\rho-\rho_c$ the interior metric is solved exactly. It is matched with the Schwarzschild metric, which is deformed in a narrow range beyond the horizon. The solution is regular everywhere, with a specific shape at the origin. The gravitational redshift at the horizon remains finite but is large, $z\sim 10^{23}$$M_\odot/M$. Time keeps its standard role also in the interior. The energy of the Schwarzschild metric, shown to be minus infinity in the General Theory of Relativity, is regularized in this setup, resulting in $E=Mc^2$."
1733132,"We present an improved QCD light-cone sum rule (LCSR) calculation of the B→K and Bs→K form factors by including SU(3)-symmetry breaking corrections. We use recently updated K meson distribution amplitudes which incorporate the complete SU(3)-breaking structure. By applying the method of direct integration in the complex plane, which is presented in detail, the analytical extraction of the imaginary parts of LCSR hard-scattering amplitudes becomes unnecessary and therefore the complexity of the calculation is greatly reduced. The values obtained for the relevant B(s)→K form factors are as follows: fBK+(0)=0.36-0.04+0.05, fBsK+(0)=0.30-0.03+0.04, and fBKT(0)=0.38±0.05, fBsKT(0)=0.30±0.05. By comparing with the B→π form factors extracted recently by the same method, we find the following SU(3) violation among the B→light form factors: fBK+(0)/fBπ+(0)=1.38-0.10+0.11, fBsK+(0)/fBπ+(0)=1.15-0.09+0.17, fBKT(0)/fBπT(0)=1.49-0.06+0.18, and fBsKT(0)/fBπT(0)=1.17-0.11+0.15."
1733133,"Weak decays of beauty baryons like Λ b(bar &Lambda_b; ) into Λ (bar Λ ) and V(JP = 1-), where both decay products are polarized, offer interesting opportunities to perform tests of time reversal, CP violations and of CPT invariance. We propose a model-independent parametrization, via spin density matrix, of the angular distribution, of the polarizations and of some polarization correlations of the decay products. The transverse component of the polarization and two polarization correlations are sensitive to time reversal violations. Moreover several CP- and CPT-odd observables are singled out."

1733135,"We report the first calculation of persistent current in two coupled rings which form a character ``8'' genus g=2 structure. We obtain an exact solution for the persistent current and investigated the exact solution numerically. For two large coupled rings with equal fluxes, we find that the persistent current in the two coupled rings is equal to that in a single ring. For opposite fluxes the energy has a chaotic structure. For both cases the periodicity is $h/e$. This results are obtained within an extension of Dirac's second class method to fermionic constraints. This theory can be tested in the ballistic regime."

These identities are analogous to the Birman-Krein formula and the Eisenbud-Wigner formula in quantum scattering theory."

1733138,"Sturmian sequences are well-known as the ones having minimal complexity over a 2-letter alphabet. They are also the balanced sequences over a 2-letter alphabet and the sequences describing discrete lines. They are famous and have been extensively studied since the 18th century. One of the extensions of these sequences over a k-letter alphabet, with k≥3, is the episturmian sequences, which generalizes a construction of Sturmian sequences using the palindromic closure operation. There exists a finite version of the Sturmian sequences called the Christoffel words. They have been known since the works of Christoffel and have interested many mathematicians. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of Christoffel words for an alphabet with 3 letters or more, using the episturmian morphisms. We call them the epichristoffel words. We define this new class of finite words and show how some of the properties of the Christoffel words can be generalized naturally or not for this class."
1733139,"In this essentially Unsolved Problems of Noise (UPoN) paper we further study the question recently posed in Fluctuation and Noise Letters (December 2007), if there is and interaction between bodies with correlated information content, and weather the observed weight transients during/after changing the information content in memory devices is due to a new type of interaction, a new type of ""fifth force"", or it is only a classical mechanism. We briefly discuss the issue of the great experimental uncertainty of the Newtonian gravitation constant. We also mention the peculiar experiments about sudden weight changes of humans and animals at the moment of death. The extended monitoring of four 4GB flash drives with no casing and various information content indicate a significant correlation between their weight variations and the fluctuations of ambient humidity. This is an evidence for the role of humidity and hygroscopic components, at least, for long-term weight fluctuations. A sequence of information changing experiments with such a flash drives at stable humidity conditions shows a significant variability of the transients of the absolute mass with some dependence on the information content. Finally, a related new experiment was carried out with olive oil and chilli pepper powder that was dissolved in it while the mass variations were recorded and a positive mass transient of 0.3 milligram was observed for about 10 minutes. The process represents the writing of new random information into a medium. The only classical interpretation of this mechanism would be the compression of trapped air between the grains by the surface tension of the oil, or that of in pores by capillary forces, and the resulting decrease of the Archimedes force due volume reduction."
1733140,"A perpendicular ion drift is investigated as a mechanism for the generation of magnetic field structures in a highly collisional dusty plasma. The basic dissipation mechanism is assumed to be the dust-neutrals momentum exchange, so that plasmas with a small ionization fraction are natural candidates for experiments. The model reduces to a nonlinear partial differential equation for the vector potential. The conditions for linear instability are determined. The stationary states are periodic arrangements for the magnetic field, described by a Lienard equation. The fully depleted (ion-dust) case is also considered in detail. Applications to planetary rings, comets and dust acoustic instability experiments are analyzed. A necessary condition for the validity of the model is a sufficiently slow time-scale of the generated magnetic fields. Comment: 16 pages, 2 figures"
1733141,"We present an optimization scheme that employs a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to determine the properties of low-lying nucleon excitations within a realistic photo-pion production model based upon an effective Lagrangian. We show that with this modern optimization technique it is possible to reliably assess the parameters of the resonances and the associated error bars as well as to identify weaknesses in the models. To illustrate the problems the optimization process may encounter, we provide results obtained for the nucleon resonances $\Delta$(1230) and $\Delta$(1700). The former can be easily isolated and thus has been studied in depth, while the latter is not as well known experimentally."

The matching hypersurface is also perturbed arbitrarily and, in all cases, the perturbations are decomposed into scalars using the Hodge operator on the sphere. This allows us to write down the matching conditions in a compact way. In particular, we find that the existence of a perturbed (rotating, stationary and vacuum) Schwarzschild cavity in a perturbed FLRW universe forces the cosmological perturbations to satisfy constraints that link rotational and gravitational wave perturbations. We also prove that if the perturbation on the FLRW side vanishes identically, then the vacuole must be perturbatively static and hence Schwarzschild. By the dual nature of the problem, the first result translates into links between rotational and gravitational wave perturbations on a perturbed Oppenheimer-Snyder model, where the perturbed FLRW dust collapses in a perturbed Schwarzschild environment which rotates in equilibrium. The second result implies in particular that no region described by FLRW can be a source of the Kerr metric."
1733143,"We combine high-resolution images in four optical/infrared bands, obtained with the laser guide star adaptive optics (LGSAO) system on the Keck telescope and with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), to study the gravitational lens system SDSS J0737+3216 (lens redshift 0.3223, source redshift 0.5812). We show that (under favorable observing conditions) ground-based images are comparable to those obtained with HST in terms of precision in the determination of the parameters of both the lens mass distribution and the background source. We also quantify the systematic errors associated with both the incomplete knowledge of the PSF and the uncertain process of lens galaxy light removal and find that similar accuracy can be achieved with Keck LGSAO as with HST. We then exploit this well-calibrated combination of optical and gravitational telescopes to perform a multiwavelength study of the source galaxy at 0.01'' effective resolution. We find the Sérsic index to be indicative of a disklike object, but the measured half-light radius (re = 0.59 ± 0.007 stat ± 0.1 sys kpc) and stellar mass (M* = 2.0 ± 1.0 stat ± 0.8 sys × 109 M☉) place it more than 3 σ away from the local disk size-mass relation. The SDSS J0737+3216 source has the characteristics of the most compact faint blue galaxies studied and comparable size and mass to dwarf early-type galaxies in the local universe. With the aid of gravitational telescopes to measure individual objects' brightness profiles to 10% accuracy, the study of the high-redshift size-mass relation may be extended by an order of magnitude or more beyond existing surveys at the low-mass end, thus providing a new observational test of galaxy formation models."
1733144,"After an introduction to some basic issues in non-commutative geometry (Gel'fand duality, spectral triples), we present a ""panoramic view"" of the status of our current research program on the use of categorical methods in the setting of A.Connes' non-commutative geometry: morphisms/categories of spectral triples, categorification of Gel'fand duality. We conclude with a summary of the expected applications of ""categorical non-commutative geometry"" to structural questions in relativistic quantum physics: (hyper)covariance, quantum space-time, (algebraic) quantum gravity."
1733145,"We present a comparison between the 2001 XMM–Newton and 2005 Suzaku observations of the quasar, PG 1211+143, at z = 0.0809. Variability is observed in the 7 keV iron K-shell absorption line (at 7.6 keV in the quasar frame), which is significantly weaker in 2005 than during the 2001 XMM–Newton observation. From a recombination time-scale of <4 yr, this implies an absorber density n > 4 × 103 cm−3, while the absorber column is 5 × 1022 < NH < 1 × 1024 cm−2. Thus, the size scale of the absorber is too compact (pc scale) and the surface brightness of the dense gas too high (by 9–10 orders of magnitude) to arise from local hot gas, such as the local bubble, group or warm/hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), as suggested by McKernan, Yaqoob & Reynolds. Instead, the iron K-shell absorption must be associated with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) outflow with mildly relativistic velocities. Finally, we show that the association of the absorption in PG 1211+143 with local hot gas is simply a coincidence, and the comparison between the recession and iron K absorber outflow velocities in other AGN does not reveal a one-to-one kinematic correlation."
1733146,"We present a simple bijection between Baxter permutations of size n and plane bipolar orientations with n edges. This bijection translates several classical parameters of permutations into natural parameters of orientations, and has remarkable symmetry properties. By specialising it to Baxter permutations avoiding the pattern 3142, we obtain a bijection with non-separable planar maps, which had been described only in an implicit recursive manner so far (up to simple symmetries). A further specialization yields a bijection between permutations avoiding 3142 and 2413 and series-parallel maps."
1733147,"Let E be a globally generated vector bundle of rank e ≥ 2 over a reduced irreducible projective variety X of dimension n defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let L := det(E). If deg(E) := deg(L) = L n > 0 and E is not isomorphic to \({\mathcal{O}_X^{e-1}\oplus L}\), we obtain a sharp bound$${\rm deg}(E)\geq h^0(X,E)-e$$on the degree of E, proving also that deg(L) = h 0(X, L) − n if equality holds. As an application, we obtain a Del Pezzo–Bertini type theorem on varieties of minimal degree for subvarieties of Grassmannians, as well as a bound on the sectional genus for subvarieties \({X \subset \mathbb{G}(k,N)}\) of degree at most N + 1."
1733148,"Demanding a consistent quantum field theory description of spin 1/2 particles near a circular Fermi surface in 2d leads to a unique fermionic theory with relevant quartic interactions which has an emergent Lorentz symmetry and automatically has an Sp(4) = SO(5) internal symmetry. The free theory has resistivity linear in temperature. The interacting theory has a low-energy interacting fixed point and is thus a non-Landau/Fermi liquid. Anti-ferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) order parameters are bilinears in the fields and form the 5-dimensional vector representation of SO(5). An AF phase occurs at low doping which terminates in a first order transition. We incorporate momentum dependent scattering of Cooper pairs near the Fermi surface to 1-loop and derive a new kind of SC gap equation beyond mean field with a d-wave gap solution. Taking into account the renormalization group (RG) scaling properties near the low energy fixed point, we calculate the complete phase diagram as a function of doping, which shows some universal geometric features. The d-wave SC dome terminates on the over-doped side at the fixed point of the RG,which is a quantum critical point. Optimal doping is estimated to occur just below 3/2\pi^2. The critical temperature for SC at optimal doping is set mainly by the universal nodal Fermi velocity and lattice spacing, and is estimated to average around 140K for LSCO. The pseudogap energy scale is identified as the RG scale of the coupling. Comment: published version"

1733150,"We conducted an exploratory search for quasars at z ~ 6-8, using the Early Data Release (EDR) from the United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) cross-matched to panoramic optical imagery. High-redshift quasar candidates are chosen using multi-color selection in i, z, Y, J, H, and K bands. After removal of apparent instrumental artifacts, our candidate list consisted of 34 objects. We further refined this list with deeper imaging in the optical for ten of our candidates. Twenty-five candidates were followed up spectroscopically in the near-infrared and in the optical. We confirmed 25 of our spectra as very low-mass main-sequence stars or brown dwarfs, which were indeed expected as the main contaminants of this exploratory search. The lack of quasar detection is not surprising: the estimated probability of finding a single z > 6 quasar down to the limit of UKIDSS in 27.3 deg2 of the EDR is <5%. We find that the most important limiting factor in this work is the depth of the available optical data. Experience gained in this pilot project can help refine high-redshift quasar selection criteria for subsequent UKIDSS data releases."
1733151,"Building on the work of K. Chiba (J. Algebra 263 (2003), 75-87), we present sufficient conditions for the completion of a division ring with respect to the metric defined by a discrete valuation function to contain a free field, i.e. the universal field of fractions of a free associative algebra. Several applications to division rings generated by torsion-free nilpotent groups, skew Laurent series and related division rings are discussed."
1733152,"We analyze gauge coupling unification in the context of heterotic strings on anisotropic orbifolds. This construction is very much analogous to effective 5 dimensional orbifold GUT field theories. Our analysis assumes three fundamental scales, the string scale, $\mstring$, a compactification scale, $\mc$, and a mass scale for some of the vector-like exotics, $\mex$; the other exotics are assumed to get mass at $\mstring$. In the particular models analyzed, we show that gauge coupling unification is not possible with $\mex = \mc$ and in fact we require $\mex \ll \mc \sim 3 \times 10^{16}$ GeV. We find that about 10% of the parameter space has a proton lifetime (from dimension 6 gauge exchange) $10^{33} {\rm yr} \lesssim\tau(p\to \pi^0e^+) \lesssim 10^{36} {\rm yr}$. The other 80% of the parameter space gives proton lifetimes below Super-K bounds. The next generation of proton decay experiments should be sensitive to the remaining parameter space."
1733153,"We study transverse conformal Killing forms on foliations and prove a Gallot-Meyer theorem for foliations. Moreover, we show that on a foliation with $C$-positive normal curvature, if there is a closed basic 1-form $\phi$ such that $\Delta_B\phi=qC\phi$, then the foliation is transversally isometric to the quotient of a $q$-sphere."
1733154,"We study matter at high density and temperature using a chiral lagrangian in which the breaking of scale invariance is regulated by the value of a scalar field, called dilaton \cite{Heide:1993yz,Carter:1995zi,Carter:1996rf,Carter:1997fn}. We provide a phase diagram describing the restoration of chiral and scale symmetries. We show that chiral symmetry is restored at large temperatures, but at low temperatures it remains broken at all densities. We also show that scale invariance is more easily restored at low rather than large baryon densities. The masses of vector mesons scale with the value of the dilaton and their values initially slightly decrease with the density but then they increase again for densities larger than $\sim 3 \rho_0$. The pion mass increases continuously with the density and at $\rho_0$ and T=0 its value is $\sim$ 30 MeV larger than in the vacuum. We show that the model is compatible with the bounds stemming from astrophysics, as e.g. the one associated with the maximum mass of a neutron star. The most striking feature of the model is a very significant softening at large densities, which manifests also as a strong reduction of the adiabatic index. While the softening has probably no consequence for Supernova explosion via the direct mechanism, it could modify the signal in gravitational waves associated with the merging of two neutron stars.

1733155,"We study experimentally the influence of confinement on the penetration depth of impacting spheres into a granular medium contained in a finite cylindrical vessel. The presence of close lateral walls reduces the penetration depth, and the characteristic distance for these lateral wall effects is found to be of the order of one sphere diameter. The influence of the bottom wall is found to have a much shorter range."
1733156,"Using four-dimensional unitarity and MHV-rules we calculate the one-loop MHV amplitudes with all external particles in the adjoint representation for N=2 supersymmetric QCD with N_f fundamental flavours. We start by considering such amplitudes in the superconformal N=4 gauge theory where the N=4 supersymmetric Ward identities (SWI) guarantee that all MHV amplitudes for all types of external particles are given by the corresponding tree-level result times a universal helicity- and particle-type-independent contribution. In N=2 SQCD the MHV amplitudes differ from those for N=4 for general values of N_f and N_c. However, for N_f=2N_c where the N=2 SQCD is conformal, the N=2 MHV amplitudes (with all external particles in the adjoint representation) are identical to the N=4results. This factorisation at one-loop motivates us to pose a question if there may be a BDS-like factorisation for these amplitudes which also holds at higher orders of perturbation theory in superconformal N=2 theory. Comment: In v2 we consider only MHV amplitudes with all external particles in the adjoint representation. References added. 17 pages, 3 figures"

1733158,"There is a significant possibility that astrophysical black holes with nearly-extremal spins exist. Numerical simulations of such systems require suitable initial data. In this paper, we examine three methods of constructing binary-black-hole initial data, focusing on their ability to generate black holes with nearly-extremal spins: (i) Bowen-York initial data, including standard puncture data (based on conformal flatness and Bowen-York extrinsic curvature), (ii) standard quasi-equilibrium initial data (based on the extended-conformal-thin-sandwich equations, conformal flatness, and maximal slicing), and (iii) quasi-equilibrium data based on the superposition of Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the two conformally-flat methods (i) and (ii) perform similarly, with spins up to about 0.99 obtainable at the initial time. However, in an evolution, we expect the spin to quickly relax to a significantly smaller value around 0.93 as the initial geometry relaxes. For quasi-equilibrium superposed Kerr-Schild (SKS) data [method (iii)], we construct initial data with initial spins as large as 0.9998. We evolve SKS data sets with spins of 0.93 and 0.97 and find that the spin drops by only a few parts in $10^4$ during the initial relaxation; therefore, we expect that SKS initial data will allow evolutions of binary black holes with relaxed spins above 0.99. [Abstract abbreviated; full abstract also mentions several secondary results.]"
1733159,"We have observed a Fermi-surface (FS) induced lattice modulation in a YBCO superconductor with a wavevector along CuO chains, {\it i.e.} ${\bf q}_1$=(0,$\delta$,0). The value of $\delta\sim0.21$ is twice the Fermi wavevector ($2{\bf k}_F$) along {\bf b*} connecting nearly nested FS `ridges'. The ${\bf q}_1$ modulation exists only within O-vacancy-ordered islands (characterized by ${\bf q}_0$=$(\frac14,0,0))$ and persists well above and below $T_c$. Our results are consistent with the presence of a FS-induced charge-density wave."
1733160,"Anomalous dimensions of high-twist Wilson operators have a nontrivial scaling behavior in the limit when their Lorentz spin grows exponentially with the twist. To describe the corresponding scaling function in planar N=4 SYM theory, we analyze an integral equation recently proposed by Freyhult, Rej and Staudacher and argue that at strong coupling it can be casted into a form identical to the thermodynamical Bethe Ansatz equations for the nonlinear O(6) sigma model. This result is in a perfect agreement with the proposal put forward by Alday and Maldacena within the dual string description, that the scaling function should coincide with the energy density of the nonlinear O(6) sigma model embedded into AdS5×S5."
1733161,Born differential cross sections and the lowest-order radiative correction to them are obtained in the kinematics of large-angle final photons emission in high-energy electron-positron annihilation processes. Taking into account possible emission of real soft and hard photons in collinear kinematics we show the validity of the Drell-Yan form of differential cross section with the nonsinglet structure functions of initial leptons. The leading and next-to leading contribution to the cross sections is obtained. The relevant numerical estimations are presented.
1733162,"We present detailed Fourier modeling of the radio remnant of Supernova 1987A, using high-resolution 9 GHz and 18 GHz data taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array over the period 1992 to 2008. We develop a parameterized three-dimensional torus model for the expanding radio shell, in which the emission is confined to an inclined equatorial belt; our model also incorporates both a correction for light travel-time effects and an overall east-west gradient in the radio emissivity. By deriving an analytic expression for the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the projected three-dimensional brightness distribution, we can fit our spatial model directly to the interferometric visibility data. This provides robust estimates to the radio morphology at each epoch. The best-fit results suggest a constant remnant expansion at 4000 +/- 400 km/s over the 16-year period covered by the observations. The model fits also indicate substantial mid-latitude emission, extending to 40 degree on either side of the equatorial plane. This likely corresponds to the extra-planar structure seen in H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$ emission from the supernova reverse shock, and broadly supports hydrodynamic models in which the complex circumstellar environment was produced by a progression of interacting winds from the progenitor. Our model quantifies the clear asymmetry seen in the radio images: we find that the eastern half of the radio remnant is consistently ~40 brighter than the western half at all epochs, which may result from an asymmetry in the ejecta distribution between these two hemispheres.

1733163,"Consistent coupling of effective field theories with a quantum theory of gravity appears to require bounds on the rank of the gauge group and the amount of matter. We consider landscapes of field theories subject to such to boundedness constraints. We argue that appropriately “coarse-grained” aspects of the randomly chosen field theory in such landscapes, such as the fraction of gauge groups with ranks in a given range, can be statistically predictable. To illustrate our point we show how the uniform measures on simple classes of N=1 quiver gauge theories localize in the vicinity of theories with certain typical structures. Generically, this approach would predict a high energy theory with very many gauge factors, with the high rank factors largely decoupled from the low rank factors if we require asymptotic freedom for the latter."
1733164,"We have measured Lick index equivalent widths to derive luminosity weighted stellar ages and metallicities for thin and thick disk dominated regions of 9 edge-on disk galaxies with the ARC 3.5 meter telescope at Apache Point Observatory. In all cases, the thick disks are confirmed to be old stellar populations, with typical ages between 4 and 10 Gyr. The thin disks are uniformly younger than the thick disks, and show strong radial age gradients, with the outer regions of the disks being younger than 1 Gyr. We do not detect any significant metallicity differences or alpha-element enhancement in the thick disk stars compared to the thin disk, due to the insensitivity of the Lick indices to these differences at low metallicity. We compare these results to thick disks measured in other systems and to predictions from thick disk formation models. Comment: 14 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ"
1733165,"In this paper we study surface operators in Script N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We compute surface operator observables, such as the expectation value of surface operators, the correlation function of surface operators with local operators, and the correlation function of surface operators with Wilson and 't Hooft loops. The calculations are performed using three different realizations of surface operators, corresponding respectively to the gauge theory path integral definition, the probe brane description in AdS5 × S5 and the ``bubbling'' supergravity description of surface operators. We find remarkable agreement between the different calculations performed using the three different realizations."
1733166,"We examine the behavior of the spectral function for the trace of the stress tensor in QCD in the two regimes where it is possible to make analytical progress; weak coupling, and close to a second order QCD phase transition. We determine the behavior of the bulk viscosity in each regime. We discuss the problem of analytic continuation of the (lattice) Euclidean correlation function to determine the spectral function. In each case the spectral function has a narrow peak at small frequency; its shape would be challenging to extract accurately from lattice data with error bars."
1733167,"Several supersymmetric models with extended gauge structures, motivated by either grand unification or by neutrino mass generation, predict light doubly-charged Higgsinos. In this work we study productions and decays of doubly-charged Higgsinos present in left-right supersymmetric models, and show that they invariably lead to novel collider signals not found in the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) or in any of its extensions motivated by the \mu problem or even in extra dimensional theories. We investigate their distinctive signatures at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in both pair-- and single--production modes, and show that they are powerful tools in determining the underlying model via the measurements at the LHC experiments."
1733168,"Two-dimensional (p(x)+ip(y)) superfluids or superconductors offer a playground for studying intriguing physics such as quantum teleportation, non-Abelian statistics, and topological quantum computation. Creating such a superfluid in cold fermionic atom optical traps using p-wave Feshbach resonance is turning out to be challenging. Here we propose a method to create a p(x)+ip(y) superfluid directly from an s-wave interaction making use of a topological Berry phase, which can be artificially generated. We discuss ways to detect the spontaneous Hall mass current, which acts as a diagnostic for the chiral p-wave superfluid."
1733169,"The notion of crossed product with a coquasi-Hopf algebra H is introduced and studied. The result of such a crossed product is an algebra in the monoidal category of right H-comodules. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for two crossed products to be equivalent. Then, two structure theorems for coquasi-Hopf modules are given. First, these are relative Hopf modules over the crossed product. Second, the category of coquasi-Hopf modules is trivial, namely equivalent to the category of modules over the starting associative algebra. In deep connection with the crossed product is the notion of a cleft extension over a coquasi-Hopf algebra, introduced by the author in a previous paper. A Morita context of Hom spaces is constructed in order to explain these extensions, which are shown to be equivalent with crossed product with invertible cocycle."
1733170,"AIMS: To study the structure of nearby (< 500 pc) dense starless and star-forming cores with the particular goal to identify and understand evolutionary trends in core properties, and to explore the nature of Very Low Luminosity Objects (< 0.1 L_sun; VeLLOs). METHODS: Using the MAMBO bolometer array, we create maps unusually sensitive to faint (few mJy per beam) extended (approx. 5 arcmin) thermal dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm wavelength. Complementary information on embedded stars is obtained from Spitzer, IRAS, and 2MASS. RESULTS: Our maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize extended emission features (``subcores'') and compact intensity peaks in our data separately to pay attention to this complexity. We derive, e.g., sizes, masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well as column densities and related properties for the peaks. Combination with archival infrared data then enables the derivation of bolometric luminosities and temperatures, as well as envelope masses, for the young embedded stars. CONCLUSIONS: (abridged) Starless and star-forming cores occupy the same parameter space in many core properties; a picture of dense core evolution in which any dense core begins to actively form stars once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e.g., mass, density, or both, is inconsistent with our data. Comparison of various evolutionary indicators for young stellar objects in our sample (e.g., bolometric temperatures) reveals inconsistencies between some of them, possibly suggesting a revision of some of these indicators.

1733171,"In this paper we study the properties of pseudobulges (bulges that appear similar to disk galaxies) and classical bulges (bulges which appear similar to E-type galaxies) in bulge-disk decompositions. We show that the distribution of bulge Sersic indices is bimodal, and this bimodality correlates with the morphology of the bulge. Pseudobulges have n<2 and classical bulges have n>2 with little overlap. Also, pseudobulges do not follow the correlations of Sersic index with structural parameters or the photometric projections of the fundamental plane in the same way as classical bulges and elliptical galaxies do. We find that pseudobulges are systematically flatter than classical bulges and thus more disk-like in both their morphology and shape. We do not find significant differences between different bulge morphologies that we are collectively calling pseudobulges (nuclear spirals, nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear patchiness) appear to behave similarly in all parameter correlations. In Sersic index, flattening, and bulge-to-total ratio, the distinction appears to be between classical bulges and pseudobulges, not between different pseudobulge morphologies. The Sersic index of the pseudobulges does not correlate with B/T, in contrast to classical bulges. Also, the half-light radius of the pseudobulge correlates with the scale length of the disk; this is not the case for classical bulges. The correlation of Sersic index and scale lengths with bulge morphology suggests that secular evolution is creating pseudobulges with low-Sersic index, and that other processes (e.g. major mergers) are responsible for the higher Sersic index in classical bulges and elliptical galaxies.

1733172,"This is the Phase 1 Report on the Experimental Probe of Inflationary Cosmology (EPIC), a mission concept study for NASA's Einstein Inflation Probe. When we began our study we sought to answer five fundamental implementation questions: 1) can foregrounds be measured and subtracted to a sufficiently low level?; 2) can systematic errors be controlled?; 3) can we develop optics with sufficiently large throughput, low polarization, and frequency coverage from 30 to 300 GHz?; 4) is there a technical path to realizing the sensitivity and systematic error requirements?; and 5) what are the specific mission architecture parameters, including cost? Detailed answers to these questions are contained in this report. Currently in Phase 2, we are exploring a mission concept targeting a ~2m aperture, in between the two options described in the current report with a small (~30 cm) and large (~4m) missions."
1733173,"We test the predictions of (a weakened version of) the L-functions Ratios conjecture for the family of cuspidal newforms of weight k and level N, with either k fixed and N → ∞ through the primes or N = 1 and k → ∞. We study the main and lower-order terms in the 1-level density. We provide evidence for the Ratios conjecture by computing and confirming its predictions up to a power savings in the family's cardinality, at least for test functions whose Fourier transforms are supported in (−2, 2). We do this both for the weighted and unweighted 1-level density (where in the weighted case we use the Petersson weights), thus showing that either formulation may be used. These two 1-level densities differ by a term of size 1/log (k2 N). Finally, we show that there is another way of extending the sums arising in the Ratios conjecture, leading to a different answer (although the answer is such a lower-order term that it is hopeless to observe which is correct)."
1733174,"We explore the phenomenology of Kaluza-Klein (KK) dark matter in very general models with universal extra dimensions (UEDs), emphasizing the complementarity between high-energy colliders and dark matter direct detection experiments. In models with relatively small mass splittings between the dark matter candidate and the rest of the (colored) spectrum, the collider sensitivity is diminished, but direct detection rates are enhanced. UEDs provide a natural framework for such mass degeneracies. We consider both 5-dimensional and 6-dimensional non-minimal UED models, and discuss the detection prospects for various KK dark matter candidates: the KK photon \gamma_1 (5D) the KK Z-boson Z_1 (5D) and the spinless KK photon \gamma_H (6D). We combine collider limits such as electroweak precision data and expected LHC reach, with cosmological constraints from WMAP and the sensitivity of current or planned direct detection experiments. Allowing for general mass splittings, we show that neither colliders, nor direct detection experiments by themselves can explore all of the relevant KK dark matter parameter space. Nevertheless, they probe different parameter space regions and the combination of the two types of constraints can be quite powerful. For example, in the case of \gamma_1 in 5D UEDs the relevant parameter space will be almost completely covered by the combined LHC and direct detection sensitivities expected in the near future.

1733179,"Using far-infrared emission maps taken by IRAS and Spitzer and a near-infrared extinction map derived from 2MASS data, we have made dust temperature and column density maps of the Perseus molecular cloud. We show that the emission from transiently heated very small grains and the big grain dust emissivity vary as a function of extinction and dust temperature, with higher dust emissivities for colder grains. This variable emissivity can not be explained by temperature gradients along the line of sight or by noise in the emission maps, but is consistent with grain growth in the higher density and lower temperature regions. By accounting for the variations in the dust emissivity and VSG emission, we are able to map the temperature and column density of a nearby molecular cloud with better accuracy than has previously been possible.

Applications to AdS3 supergravity and flux compactifications are addressed."
1733181,"The wave function of a non-relativistic particle in a periodic potential admits oscillatory solutions, the Bloch waves. In the presence of a random noise contribution to the potential the wave function is localized. We outline a new proof of this Anderson localization phenomenon in one spatial dimension, extending the classical result to the case of a periodic background potential. The proof makes use of techniques previously developed to study the effects of noise on reheating in inflationary cosmology, employing methods of random matrix theory."
1733182,"In this paper, we discuss the problem of the software engineering of a class of business spreadsheet models. A methodology for structured software development is proposed, which is based on structured analysis of data, represented as Jackson diagrams. It is shown that this analysis allows a straightforward modularisation, and that individual modules may be represented with indentation in the block-structured form of structured programs. The benefits of structured format are discussed, in terms of comprehensibility, ease of maintenance, and reduction in errors. The capability of the methodology to provide a modular overview in the model is described, and examples are given. The potential for a reverse-engineering tool, to transform existing spreadsheet models is discussed."
1733183,"Students learning how to apply spreadsheets to accounting problems are not always well served by the built-in financial functions. Problems can arise because of differences between UK and US practice, through anomalies in the functions themselves, and because the promptings of Wizards' engender an attitude of filling in the blanks on the screen, and hoping for the best. Some examples of these problems are described, and suggestions are presented for ways of improving the situation. Principally, it is suggested that spreadsheet prompts and 'Help' screens should offer integrated guidance, covering some aspects of financial practice, as well as matters of spreadsheet technique."
1733184,"In many applications such as data compression, imaging or genomic data analysis, it is important to approximate a given tensor by a tensor that is sparsely representable. For matrices, i.e. 2-tensors, such a representation can be obtained via the singular value decomposition which allows to compute the best rank $k$ approximations. For $t$-tensors with $t>2$ many generalizations of the singular value decomposition have been proposed to obtain low tensor rank decompositions. In this paper we will present a different approach which is based on best subspace approximations, which present an alternative generalization of the singular value decomposition to tensors."
1733185,"We present the first mid-infrared (MIR) detection of a field brown dwarf (BD) and the first ground-based MIR measurements of a disk around a young BD candidate. We prove the absence of warm dust surrounding the field BD LP 944-20. In the case of the young BD candidate Cha Halpha2, we find clear evidence for thermal dust emission from a disk. Surprisingly, the object does not exhibit any silicate feature as previously predicted. We show that the flat spectrum can be explained by an optically thick flat dust disk but not by a flared one."
1733186,"We present a computational study of a visualization method for invariant sets based on ergodic partition theory, first proposed by Mezić (Ph.D. thesis, Caltech, 1994) and Mezić and Wiggins [Chaos 9, 213 (1999)]. The algorithms for computation of the time averages of observables on phase space are developed and used to provide an approximation of the ergodic partition of the phase space. We term the graphical representation of this approximation--based on time averages of observables--a mesochronic plot (from Greek: meso--mean, chronos--time). The method is useful for identifying low-dimensional projections (e.g., two-dimensional slices) of invariant structures in phase spaces of dimensionality bigger than two. We also introduce the concept of the ergodic quotient space, obtained by assigning a point to every ergodic set, and provide an embedding method whose graphical representation we call the mesochronic scatter plot. We use the Chirikov standard map as a well-known and dynamically rich example in order to illustrate the implementation of our methods. In addition, we expose applications to other higher dimensional maps such as the Froéschle map for which we utilize our methods to analyze merging of resonances and, the three-dimensional extended standard map for which we study the conjecture on its ergodicity [I. Mezić, Physica D 154, 51 (2001)]. We extend the study in our next paper [Z. Levnajić and I. Mezić, e-print arXiv:0808.2182] by investigating the visualization of periodic sets using harmonic time averages. Both of these methods are related to eigenspace structure of the Koopman operator [I. Mezić and A. Banaszuk, Physica D 197, 101 (2004)]."
1733187,We characterize unitary representations of braid groups $B_n$ of degree linear in $n$ and finite images of such representations of degree exponential in $n$.
1733188,"Although cognitive science has discovered several methods for increasing the learning of complex skills, such as physics problem solving, detailed examination of verbal protocols suggests there is still room for improvement. Basically, students do not always apply the meta-cognitive strategies that the instruction invites. For instance, when prompted to self-explain, students may still choose to not explain. We conjecture that most students know which meta-cognitive strategies are good and bad. When they work in pairs, they are more likely to choose the good strategies. We hypothesize that social accountability improves meta-cognitive strategy choice, which thereby improves learning. Our experiment compared individuals and pairs learning from state-of-the-art instruction. The results suggest that the dyads solved more problems and requested fewer hints during problem solving than individuals. We also discovered a new form of self-explanation, wherein students generate explanations to account for the differences between their solutions and the instructor's.

1733189,This paper describes a framework for a systematic classification of spreadsheet errors. This classification or taxonomy of errors is aimed at facilitating analysis and comprehension of the different types of spreadsheet errors. The taxonomy is an outcome of an investigation of the widespread problem of spreadsheet errors and an analysis of specific types of these errors. This paper contains a description of the various elements and categories of the classification and is supported by appropriate examples.
1733190,"We analyze the 1496 days of SuperKamiokande data to put limits on the nue, anti-nue, numu + nutau and anti-numu + anti-nutau components of the diffuse flux of supernova neutrinos, in different energy intervals and for different neutrino energy spectra. By considering the presence of only one component at a time, we find the following bounds at 90% C.L. and for neutrino energy E>19.3$ MeV: Phi_{nue}<73.3-154 cm^-2 s^-1, Phi_{anti-nue} <1.4-1.9 cm^-2 s^-1, Phi_{numu+nutau} <(1.0-1.4) 10^3 cm^-2 s^-1, and Phi_{anti-numu+ anti-nutau} <(1.3-1.8) 10^3 cm^-2 s^-1, where the intervals account for varying the neutrino spectrum. In the interval E = 22.9 - 36.9 MeV, we find Phi_{nue}<39-54 cm^-2 s^-1, which improves on the existing limit from SNO in the same energy window. Our results for numu + nutau and anti-numu + anti-nutau improve by about four orders of magnitude over the previous best constraints from LSD."
1733191,"Kossovsky recently conjectured that the distribution of leading digits of a chain of probability distributions converges to Benford's law as the length of the chain grows. We prove his conjecture in many cases, and provide an interpretation in terms of products of independent random variables and a central limit theorem. An interesting consequence is that in hierarchical Bayesian models priors tend to satisfy Benford's Law as the number of levels of the hierarchy increases, which allows us to develop some simple tests (based on Benford's law) to test proposed models. We give explicit formulas for the error terms as sums of Mellin transforms, which converges extremely rapidly as the number of terms in the chain grows. We may interpret our results as showing that certain Markov chain Monte Carlo processes are rapidly mixing to Benford's law. Comment: 15 pages, second draft: added some additional remarks on connections to Hierarchical Bayes and MCMC, fixed some typos, added additional explanations"
1733192,"Let p be an odd prime, K a finite extension of Qp, its absolute Galois group and e=e(K/Qp) its absolute ramification index. Suppose that T is a pn-torsion representation of GK that is isomorphic to a quotient of GK-stable Zp-lattices in a semi-stable representation with Hodge–Tate weights {0,…,r}. We prove that there exists a constant μ depending only on n, e and r such that the upper numbering ramification group acts on T trivially."
1733193,We report on measurements of open charm production through both hadronic and semi-leptonic decay channels in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV heavy ion collision at the STAR experiment at RHIC. We compare experimental results to theoretical predictions from pQCD. The open charm $R_{AA}$ is also presented as evidence of possible medium-induced energy loss.
1733194,"We consider several new classes of viable vector field alternatives to the inflaton and quintessence scalar fields. Spatial vector fields are shown to be compatible with the cosmological anisotropy bounds if only slightly displaced from the potential minimum while dominant, or if driving an anisotropic expansion with nearly vanishing quadropole today. The Bianchi I model with a spatial field and an isotropic fluid is studied as a dynamical system, and several types of scaling solutions are found. On the other hand, time-like fields are automatically compatible with large-scale isotropy. We show that they can be dynamically important if non-minimal gravity couplings are taken into account. As an example, we reconstruct a vector-Gauss-Bonnet model which generates the concordance model acceleration at late times and supports an inflationary epoch at high curvatures. The evolution of vortical perturbations is considered. Comment: 24 pages, 2 figures; JCAP in print"
1733195,"We present a catalog of 4780 extended sources from the outer field of M33. The catalog includes 73 previously identified clusters or planetary nebulae, 1153 likely background galaxies, and 3554 new candidate stellar clusters. The survey is based on deep ground-based images obtained with the MegaCam instrument on the CFHT telescope. We provide g'r'i' photometry for detected objects as well as estimates of the FWHM and ellipticity of their profiles. The sample includes 122 new, relatively bright, likely globular clusters. Follow-up observations of fainter candidates from our list may extend the faint-end of the observed luminosity function of globular clusters in M33 by up to 3 magnitudes. The catalog includes several cluster candidates located in the outskirts of the galaxy. These objects are promising targets for deep photometry with the HST. We present a color-magnitude diagram for one detected object, showing that it is an extended and low-surface-brightness old cluster located at an angular distance of 27' from the center of M33."
1733196,"In previous papers, we presented the discovery of a 12 s X-ray pulsar in the supernova remnant Kes 73, providing the first direct evidence for an ultramagnetized neutron star, a magnetar, with an equivalent dipole field of nearly 20 times the quantum critical magnetic field (m^2_ec^3/e&planck;). Our conclusions were based on two epochs of the measurement of the spin, along with an age estimate of the host supernova remnant. Herein, we present a spin chronology of the pulsar using additional Ginga, ASCA, RXTE, and BeppoSAX data sets spanning over a decade. The timing and spectral analyses confirm our initial results and severely limit an accretion origin for the observed flux. Over the 10 yr baseline, the pulsar is found to undergo a rapid, constant spin-down while maintaining a steady flux and an invariant pulse profile. Within the measurement uncertainties, no systematic departures from a linear spin-down are found-departures as in the case of glitches or simply stochastic fluctuations in the pulse times of arrival (e.g., red timing noise). We suggest that this pulsar is akin to the soft gamma-ray repeaters; however, it is remarkably stable and has yet to display similar outbursts. Future gamma-ray activity from this object is likely."
1733197,"There is now considerable evidence that horizontal branch (HB) stars hotter than about 11,500 K experience an enormous enhancement of their photospheric iron abundance due to radiative levitation. In globular clusters, the photospheric iron abundance can reach values of [Fe/H] ~ +0.3, or up to two orders of magnitude higher than the cluster iron abundance. Model atmospheres which take into account the iron overabundance are needed for understanding the appearance of the HB in globular cluster color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), for the derivation of accurate luminosities, gravities and masses, and for the ultraviolet spectral synthesis of old, metal-poor stellar populations."
1733198,"The UV upturn phenomenon observed in elliptical galaxies is attractive for its potential value as an age indicator of old stellar systems. We present our most recent population models for the UV evolution of elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the dominant UV sources are either metal-poor or metal-rich hot horizontal-branch (HB) stars in local giant ellipticals, but we also note that the contribution from post-asymptotic-giant-branch (PAGB) stars overwhelms the UV spectrum at higher redshifts (look-back times). The model UV spectral energy distribution (SED) is therefore strongly affected by the current uncertainty of the mean mass of PAGB stars at higher redshifts. Fortunately, our models suggest that the far-UV observations at z > 0.35 could produce strong constraint on the PAGB mass, while observations at could produce strong constraint on the PAGB mass, while observations at lower redshifts (0.15 < z < 0.30) would still provide constraints on the models on the origin of the UV upturn. Future observations of ellipticals from the STIS/HST and planned GALEX space UV facility will provide crucial database required for more concrete calibration of our UV dating techniques for old stellar systems."
1733199,"The isospin-violating decay f 1(1285) → π+π-π0 has been studied at the VES facility. This study is based on the statistics acquired in π- Be interactions at 27, 36.6 and 41 GeV/c in the diffractive reaction π- N → (f 1π-)N . The f 1(1285) → π+π-π0 decay is observed. The preliminary ratio of decay probabilities BR(f 1(1285) → π+π-π0) to BR(f 1(1285) → ηπ+π-). BR(η → γγ) is ∼ 2% ."
1733200,"We review the observational differences between gamma-ray bursts occurring on a single shell (such as in the external shock model) and multiple shells (such as in the internal shock model). We do not argue against external shocks or for internal shocks, as such, but rather against a single shell and for a central engine that is small enough to produce the typical GRB time history without violating causality or other kinematic limits. The expected profile and average spectral evolution from a single shell is compared to the average of many bursts and found to be different. The presence of gaps in many gamma-ray bursts is a strong argument against a single shell because an observer should see many causally disconnected regions at any one time.The rapid variability is also difficult to explain from a single shell because of the large number of causally disconnected regions. The pulse width as a function of time in a burst should increase because there is a one-to-one relationship between arrival time and the off-axis angle of emission. The observations show that the pulse width does not increase with time. Finally, in GRB990123 there is evidence for deceleration from the simultaneous optical observations, yet the gamma-ray pulses show no lengthening of their pulse structure. We conclude that gamma-ray bursts are caused by a relatively small central engine."
1733201,"We propose a radial velocity survey with the aim of resolving the current dispute on the LMC microlensing: in the pro-MACHO hypothesis, the lenses are halo white dwarfs or MACHOs in general; in the pro-star hypothesis, both the lenses and the sources are stars in various plausible structures of the Magellanic Clouds and the Galaxy. Star-star lensing should prefer sources at the backside of or behind the LMC disk, because lensing is most efficient if the source is located a few kpc behind a dense screen of stars, here the thin disk of the LMC. This signature of self-lensing can be searched for with a radial velocity survey, since the kinematics of the stars at the back can be markedly different from that of the majority of stars in the cold, rapidly rotating disk of the LMC. Detailed simulations of effect, together with optimal strategies for carrying out the proposed survey, are reported here. Assuming that the existing 30 or so alerted stars in the LMC are truly microlensed stars, their kinematics can test the two lensing scenarios; the confidence level varies with the still very uncertain structure of the LMC. Spectroscopy of the existing sample and future events requires about two or three good-seeing nights per year at a 4-8 m class southern telescope, either during the amplification phase or long after."
1733202,"We performed a spectral analysis of the EUVE spectrum and ROSAT data of the unique object H1504+65, which is an extremely hot post-AGB star entering the white dwarf cooling sequence. It is the only pre-white dwarf known, whose surface is free of hydrogen and helium, hence, it represents the bare core of a former AGB star. The EUV spectrum (75--150A) is dominated by strong OVI lines and we can identify a number of NeVII lines. EUVE and ROSAT data can be fitted with models between Teff=170000 K and 200000 K. We derive an extraordinarily high neon abundance (2%--5% by mass, i.e. 20--50 times solar) which we confirm by an optical NeVII line detected in a Keck HIRES echelle spectrum. This abundance is expected for 3-alpha processed matter and corroborates our understanding of H1504+65 as a C-O stellar core which has lost its entire H- and He-rich envelopes."
1733203,"The results of our observational campaigns on the two extragalactic sources Mkn 501 and Mkn 421, carried out with the Imaging Element of the TACTIC array, during March-May, 1998 and April-May, 1999, are presented. The results indicate that the two BL Lac objects (Mkn 501 and Mkn 421) were in a `low' gamma-ray emission state during both epochs of our observations."
1733204,"The Rainich's program of describing metrics induced by pure electromagnetic fields is implemented in a simpler way by using the Ernst formalism and increasing the symmetry of spacetime. Stationary metrics possessing one, two or three Killing vectors are studied and classified. Three branches of solutions exist. Electromagnetically induced mass terms appear in two of them, including a class of solutions in harmonic functions. The static subcase is discussed too. Relations to other well-known electrovacuum metrics are elucidated."
1733205,"We present subarcsecond resolution imaging and spectroscopy of the BL Lac object 1ES 1741+196 and neighboring galaxies. Based on 2-dimensional modelling, the host galaxy of 1ES 1741+196 is a very bright and large elliptical galaxy (M_R = -24.85, r_e = 51.2 kpc), whose overall luminosity distribution deviates significantly from a de Vaucouleurs profile. It is one of the most luminous and largest BL Lac host galaxies known. Closeby to 1ES 1741+196 we found two companion galaxies at the same redshift as the BL Lac itself. They are at projected distances of 7.2 and 25.2 kpc, respectively. The closer companion galaxy can be best modelled by a Sa-type galaxy, whereas the more distant companion galaxy is an elliptical. This is supported by their spectra. We detected a tidal tail emerging from the closer companion galaxy which is possibly connected with the more distant galaxy. Its surface brightness increases towards the closer companion galaxy, which suggests that material has been released from that galaxy due to tidal forces. The flat luminosity profile (beta = 0.15), high ellipticity (epsilon = 0.35) of the host galaxy of 1ES 1741+196 as well as its position angle along the impact parameter to the neighboring galaxies can be the result of tidal interaction. 1ES 1741+196 may be a BL Lac object in a triplet of interacting galaxies."
1733206,"We show how the capillary filling of microchannels is affected by posts or ridges on the sides of the channels. Ridges perpendicular to the flow direction introduce contact line pinning, which slows, or sometimes prevents, filling, whereas ridges parallel to the flow provide extra surface that may enhance filling. Patterning the microchannel surface with square posts has little effect on the ability of a channel to fill for equilibrium contact angle theta_{e} less than approximately 30 degrees . For theta_{e} greater than approximately 60 degrees , however, even a small number of posts can pin the advancing liquid front."
1733207,"Using data of five clusters of galaxies within the redshift range 0.15 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 0.25, imaged with the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) in the central $\approx$ 1 Mpc$^2$ in very good seeing conditions, we have performed an exhaustive inspection of their bright galaxy population. That range of redshift, where only a small amount of data with the required resolution and quality is available, is particularly important for the understanding of the formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies. We have inspected the color-magnitude relation (CMR) for those clusters and measured the blue fraction of galaxies in their cores to check for evidence of evolution as found in other works. Moreover, the visual classification of the galaxy morphology has been performed and the morphology-radius relation has been examined We have not found signs of evolution neither in the slope of the CMR nor in the blue fraction of galaxies. A diversity of situations regarding those parameters and in the morphological mixing has been noticed, with two out of five clusters containing a dominant late-type core population. The cluster A1878 stands out as some of its properties differ from those of the other clusters in the sample. No clear signs of evolution appear in our analysis. The data support the view that the morphology and the stellar content of the galaxies in our clusters have been already settled at z $\sim$ 0.2. Only the fraction of interacting galaxies in the clusters appear to be larger than in clusters like Coma although the number of clusters in the sample is small to give a definitive conclusion."
1733208,"By means of a toy Swiss-cheese cosmological model we will discuss how to set up and carry out in a physically meaningful way the idea of back-reaction, according to which dark energy could be an effective source. We will follow two distinct approaches. One is focused on how cosmological observables are affected by inhomogeneities, while the other is focused on a theoretical description of the inhomogeneous universe by means of a mean-field description."
1733209,"Large-N matrix models coupled via multitrace operators are used to define, via appropriate double-scaling limits, solvable models of interacting multi-string theories. It is shown that although such theories are non-local at the world-sheet level they have a simple description of the spacetime physics. Such theories share the main characteristics of similarly coupled higher-dimensional CFTs. An interpretation has been given in the past of similar continuum limits in terms of Liouville interactions that violate the Seiberg bound. We provide a novel interpretation of this relation which agrees with the current understanding of Liouville theory and analogous observations in the AdS/CFT correspondence."
1733210,"We introduce the classical stellar atmosphere problem and describe in detail its numerical solution. The problem consists of the solution of the radiation transfer equations under the constraints of hydrostatic, radiative and statistical equilibrium (non-LTE). We outline the basic idea of the Accelerated Lambda Iteration (ALI) technique and statistical methods which finally allow the construction of non-LTE model atmospheres considering the influence of millions of metal absorption lines. Some applications of the new models are presented."
1733211,"In this Letter, we show that a massive black hole (MBH) that falls into the center of a galaxy on the dynamical timescale leaves a weak cusp (rho~r-1&solm0;2) around it, which is in good agreement with the recent observations of luminous elliptical galaxies by the Hubble Space Telescope. Such an event is a natural outcome of the merging of two galaxies that have central MBHs. This is the only known mechanism for forming weak cusps in luminous elliptical galaxies. Therefore, the existence of the weak cusps indicates that the central black holes of luminous elliptical galaxies have fallen to the center from outside, most likely during a major merger event."
1733212,The X-ray selected BL Lac PKS 2155-304 has been observed using the University of Durham Mark 6 very high energy gamma ray telescope during 1998. We find no evidence for TeV emission during these recent observations when the X-ray flux was observed to be low. We have reconsidered our measurements made in 1997 November when PKS 2155-304 was in a bright X-ray state and extended X-ray and GeV gamma ray observations were made as part of a multiwavelength campaign. Comparisons are made of the VHE emission during this time with the available data from other wavelengths.
1733213,"We calculate the static and dynamic single-particle correlation functions in one-dimensional (1D) trapped Bose gases and discuss experimental measurements that can directly probe such correlation functions. Using a quantized hydrodynamic theory for the low-energy excitations, we calculate both the static and dynamic single-particle correlation functions for a 1D Bose gas that is a phase-fluctuating quasicondensate. For the static (equal-time) correlation function, our approximations and results are equivalent to those of Petrov, Shlyapnikov, and Walraven. The Fourier transform of the static single-particle correlation function gives the momentum distribution, which can be measured using Doppler-sensitive Bragg scattering experiments on a highly elongated Bose gas. We show how a two-photon Raman out-coupling experiment can measure the characteristic features of the dynamic or time-dependent single-particle correlation function of a 1D Bose quasicondensate."
1733214,"We find explicit formulae for the circular spectral measures of E7, E8. This leads to a number of general observations regarding the ADE circular measures: these are linear combinations of measures supported by the roots of unity, with real density given by certain degree 3 polynomials."
1733215,"A uniform approximation for the coherent state propagator, valid in the vicinity of phase space caustics, was recently obtained using the Maslov method combined with a dual representation for coherent states. In this paper we review the derivation of this formula and apply it to two model systems: the one-dimensional quartic oscillator and a two-dimensional chaotic system."
1733216,"Data collected in Run II of the Fermilab Tevatron are searched for indications of new electroweak scale physics. Rather than focusing on particular new physics scenarios, CDF data are analyzed for discrepancies with respect to the standard model prediction. A model-independent approach (Vista) considers the gross features of the data, and is sensitive to new large cross section physics. A quasi-model-independent approach (Sleuth) searches for a significant excess of events with large summed transverse momentum, and is particularly sensitive to new electroweak scale physics that appears predominantly in one final state. This global search for new physics in over three hundred exclusive final states in 927 pb^-1 of ppbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV reveals no such significant indication of physics beyond the standard model."
1733217,"Employing a novel type of non-commutative product in the Dirac-Kahler twisted superspace on a lattice, we formulate a field theoretically rigid framework of extended supersymmetry on a lattice. As a first example of this treatment, we calculate one-loop (in some cases any loops) quantum corrections for a twisted Wess-Zumino model with N \times N hermitian matrix superfields on a two dimensional lattice. The calculations are entirely given in a lattice superfield framework. We report that the mass and the coupling constant are exactly protected from the radiative corrections at non-zero lattice spacing as far as the planar diagrams are concerned, which implies the realization of exact lattice supersymmetry w.r.t. all the supercharges in the large-N limit.

1733218,"Errors in spreadsheet applications and models are alarmingly common (some authorities, with justification cite spreadsheets containing errors as the norm rather than the exception). Faced with this body of evidence, the auditor can be faced with a huge task - the temptation may be to launch code inspections for every spreadsheet in an organisation. This can be very expensive and time-consuming. This paper describes risk assessment based on the ""SpACE"" audit methodology used by H M Customs & Excise's tax inspectors. This allows the auditor to target resources on the spreadsheets posing the highest risk of error, and justify the deployment of those resources to managers and clients. Since the opposite of audit risk is audit assurance the paper also offers an overview of some elements of good practice in the use of spreadsheets in business."
1733219,"In this paper we show how using a relativistic kinetic equation the ensuing expression for the heat flux can be cast in the form required by Classical Irreversible Thermodynamics. Indeed, it is linearly related to the temperature and number density gradients and not to the acceleration as the so called “first order in the gradients” theories propose. Since the specific expressions for the transport coefficients are irrelevant for our purposes, the BGK form of the kinetic equation is used. Moreover, from the resulting hydrodynamic equations it is readily seen that the equilibrium state is stable in the presence of the spontaneous fluctuations in the transverse hydrodynamic velocity mode of the simple relativistic fluid. The implications of this result are thoroughly discussed."
1733220,"Interaction of single-walled carbon nanotubes with electron-donor and -acceptor molecules causes significant changes in the electronic and Raman spectra. Electron-donating molecules such as tetrathiafulvalene and aniline cause changes opposite to those caused by electron-withdrawing molecules such as nitrobenzene and tetracyanoethylene. Thus, a proportion of the semiconducting SWNTs becomes metallic on electron donation through molecular charge transfer. Electrical resistivity measurements reveal a systematic variation with electron-donating or -withdrawing power of the interacting molecules."
1733221,"We study collective interaction effects that result from the change of free quantum electrodynamic field fluctuations by one- and two-dimensional perfect metal structures. The Casimir interactions in geometries containing plates and cylinders is explicitly computed using partial wave expansions of constrained path integrals. We generalize previously obtained results and provide a more detailed description of the technical aspects of the approach. We find that the interactions involving cylinders have a weak logarithmic dependence on the cylinder radius, reflecting that one-dimensional perturbations are marginally relevant in 4D space time. For geometries containing two cylinders and one or two plates, we confirm a previously found nonmonotonic dependence of the interaction on the object’s separations which does not follow from pairwise summation of two-body forces. Qualitatively, this effect is explained in terms of fluctuating charges and currents and their mirror images."
1733222,"Interaction with electron-donor and -acceptor molecules such as aniline and nitrobenzene brings about marked changes in the D, G, G' and 2D bands of the Raman spectrum and the electronic structure of graphene, prepared by the exfoliation of graphitic oxide."
1733223,"We introduce the formalism of differential conformal superalgebras, which we show leads to the “correct” automorphism group functor and accompanying descent theory in the conformal setting. As an application, we classify forms of N=2 and N=4 conformal superalgebras by means of Galois cohomology."
1733224,"We report electrically detected magnetic resonance of phosphorus donors in a silicon field-effect transistor. An on-chip transmission line is used to generate the oscillating magnetic field allowing broadband operation. At milli-kelvin temperatures, continuous wave spectra were obtained up to 40 GHz, using both magnetic field and microwave frequency modulation. The spectra reveal the hyperfine-split electron spin resonances characteristic for Si:P and a central feature which displays the fingerprint of spin-spin scattering in the two-dimensional electron gas."
1733225,"The short-range structure of the 2+1 flavour QCD vacuum is studied through visualisations of the topological charge density. Of particular interest is a new Gaussian weighted smearing algorithm which is applied to the rough topological charge density to disclose underlying long range structure. The results provide support for the view of the QCD vacuum as a sandwich of sign-alternating sheets of charge, with a long-range structure hidden beneath."
1733227,"The problem of maximizing the average rate in a multicast network subject to a coverage constraint (minimum quality of service) is studied. Assuming the channel state information is available only at the receiver side and single antenna nodes, the highest expected rate achievable by a random user in the network, called expected typical rate, is derived in two scenarios: hard coverage constraint and soft coverage constraint. In the first case, the coverage is expressed in terms of the outage probability, while in the second case, the expected rate should satisfy certain minimum requirement. It is shown that the optimum solution in both cases (achieving the highest expected typical rate for given coverage requirements) is achieved by an infinite layer superposition code for which the optimum power allocation among the different layers is derived. For the MISO case, a suboptimal coding scheme is proposed, which is shown to be asymptotically optimal, when the number of transmit antennas grows at least logarithmically with the number of users in the network."
1733228,"In wireless packet-forwarding networks with selfish nodes, application of a repeated game can induce the nodes to forward each others' packets, so that the network performance can be improved. However, the nodes on the boundary of such networks cannot benefit from this strategy, as the other nodes do not depend on them. This problem is sometimes known as {\em the curse of the boundary nodes}. To overcome this problem, an approach based on coalition games is proposed, in which the boundary nodes can use cooperative transmission to help the backbone nodes in the middle of the network. In return, the backbone nodes are willing to forward the boundary nodes' packets. Here, the concept of core is used to study the stability of the coalitions in such games. Then three types of fairness are investigated, namely, min-max fairness using nucleolus, average fairness using the Shapley function, and a newly proposed market fairness. Based on the specific problem addressed in this paper, market fairness is a new fairness concept involving fairness between multiple backbone nodes and multiple boundary nodes. Finally, a protocol is designed using both repeated games and coalition games. Simulation results show how boundary nodes and backbone nodes form coalitions according to different fairness criteria. The proposed protocol can improve the network connectivity by about 50%, compared with pure repeated game schemes."
1733229,"The Margolus-Levitin Theorem is a limitation on the minimal evolving time of a quantum system from its initial state to its orthogonal state. It also supplies a bound on the maximal operations or events can occur within a volume of spacetime. We compare Margolus-Levitin Theorem with other form of limitation on minimal evolving time, and present covariant versions of Margolus-Levitin Theorem in special and general relativity respectively. The relation among entropy bound, maximum information flow and computational limit are discussed, by applying the covariant versions of Margolus-Levitin Theorem."
1733230,"We report on the magnetic behavior of oxygen deficient LaFeAsO1-x (x-0.10) compound, prepared by one-step synthesis, which crystallizes in the tetragonal (S.G. P4/nmm) structure at room temperature. Resistivity measurements show a strong anomaly near 150 K, which is ascribed to the spin density wave (SDW) instability. On the other hand, dc magnetization data shows paramagnetic-like features down to 5 K, with an effective moment of 0.83 mB/Fe. 57Fe Mossbauer studies (MS) have been performed at 95 and 200 K. The spectra at both temperatures are composed of two sub-spectra. At 200 K the major one (88%), is almost a singlet, and corresponds to those Fe nuclei, which have two oxygen ions in their close vicinity. The minor one, with a large quadrupole splitting, corresponds to Fe nuclei, which have vacancies in their immediate neighborhood. The spectrum at 95 K, exhibits a broadened magnetic split major (84%) sub-spectrum and a very small magnetic splitting in the minor subspectrum. The relative intensities of the subspectra facilitate in estimating the actual amount of oxygen vacancies in the compound to be 7.0(5)%, instead of the nominal LaFeAsO0.90. These results, when compared with reported 57Fe MS of non-superconducting LaFeAsO and superconducting LaFeAsO0.9F0.1, confirm that the studied LaFeAsO0.93 is a superconductivity-magnetism crossover compound of the newly discovered Fe based superconducting family."
1733231,"The nonclassicality of single photon-added thermal states in the thermal channel is investigated by exploring the volume of the negative part of the Wigner function. The Wigner functions become positive when the decay time exceeds a threshold value $\gamma{t}_c$, which only depends on the effective temperature or mean thermal photon number of the thermal channel, but not depends on the effective temperature of the initial thermal state. This phenomenon is similar with the case of single quantum excitation of classical coherent states in thermal channel. Furthermore, we firstly demonstrate $\gamma{t}_c$ is the same for arbitrary pure or mixed nonclassical optical fields with zero population in vacuum state.

1733232,"We prove the existence of homeomorphisms of a closed, orientable surface of genus 3 or greater that do not extend to any handlebody bounded by the surface. We show that such homeomorphisms exist arbitrarily deep in the Johnson filtration of the mapping class group. The second and third terms of the Johnson filtration are the well-known Torelli group and Johnson subgroup, respectively. Richard Hain has obtained very similar results by different methods."
1733233,"An Ising-type atom-atom interaction is obtained in a fiber-connected three-atom system. The interaction is effective when $\Delta\approx \gamma _{0}\gg g$. The preparations of remote two-atom and three-atom entanglement governed by this interaction are discussed in specific parameters region. The overall two-atom entanglement is very small because of the existence of the third atom. However, the three-atom entanglement can reach a maximum very close to 1."
1733234,"Au(111) or similar noble metal surfaces feature Tamm-Shockley surface states that are known to possess considerable spin-orbit splitting of the Rashba type of order $\Delta=0.1$ eV. When interacting with an electromagnetic field such states are expected to have resonances when the frequency of the field is near the energy of the spin-orbit splitting $\Delta$. These resonances originate in the intersubband transitions between spin-split subbands. Such resonances can be observed in the frequency dependence of the surface impedance. Plasmons in thin metal films are gapless and can be strongly affected by these spin resonances, acquiring significant modification of the spectrum when it intersects the $\omega=\Delta$ line. Finally, an interesting demonstration of the intersubband resonances can be obtained when metal films are coated with ionic dielectrics that have a frequency of longitudinal/transverse optical phonons above/below $\Delta$. The dielectric function between the two optical phonon frequencies is negative which forbids propagation of conventional plasmon-polaritons. However, the presence of spin-orbit-split surface states allows plasmon-polaritons to exist in this otherwise forbidden range of frequencies."
1733235,"We analyze and characterize maximal monotonicity of linear relations (set-valued operators with linear graphs). An important tool in our study are Fitzpatrick functions. The results obtained partially extend work on linear and at most single-valued operators by Phelps and Simons and by Bauschke, Borwein and Wang. Furthermore, a description of skew linear relations in terms of the Fitzpatrick family is obtained. We also answer one of Simons problems by showing that if a maximal monotone operator has a convex graph, then this graph must actually be affine."
1733236,"In this paper we characterize, in two different ways, the Newton polygons which are jacobian Newton polygons of a branch. These characterizations give in particular combinatorial criteria of irreducibility for complex series in two variables and necessary conditions which a complex curve has to satisfy in order to be the discriminant of a complex plane branch."
1733237,"Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping suggests that the broad-line regions (BLRs) of AGNs can have significant net inflow. We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar MHD processes are operating. In the scattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region."
1733238,"Astrophysical jets exist from the stellar scale up to AGN, and seem to share common features particularly in the radio. But while AGN jets are known to emit X-rays, the situation for XRB jets is not so clear. Radio jets have been resolved in several XRBs in the low/hard state, and it seems likely that some form of outflow is present whenever this state is achieved. Interestingly, the flat-to-inverted radio synchrotron emission associated with these outflows strongly correlates with the X-ray emission in several sources, suggesting that the jet plasma plays a role at higher frequencies. In this same state, there is also increasing evidence for a turnover in the IR/optical where the flat-to-inverted spectrum seems to connect to an optically thin component extending into the X-rays. We discuss how jet synchrotron emission is likely to contribute to the X-rays, in addition to inverse Compton up-scattering, providing a natural explanation for these correlations and the turnover in the IR/optical band."
1733239,"Nonequilibrium Green’s functions provide a powerful tool for computing the dynamical response and particle exchange statistics of coupled quantum systems. We formulate the theory in terms of the density matrix in Liouville space and introduce superoperator algebra that greatly simplifies the derivation and the physical interpretation of all quantities. Expressions for various observables are derived directly in real time in terms of superoperator nonequilibrium Green’s functions (SNGF), rather than the artificial time-loop required in Schwinger’s Hilbert-space formulation. Applications for computing interaction energies, charge densities, average currents, current induced fluorescence, electroluminescence and current fluctuation (electron counting) statistics are discussed."
1733240,"We investigate effects of pseudo-spin population imbalance on Mott phases in 1D trapped two-component atomic Fermi gases loaded on optical lattices based on the repulsive Hubbard model in harmonic traps. By using the density matrix renormalization group method, we numerically calculate density profiles of each component and clarify the pseudo-spin magnetism. In the case of large population imbalance, we find Wigner crystal like structures for the spatial distribution of the minority pseudo-spin component inside the central Mott core. When the population imbalance becomes small, the structure disappears, and antiferromagnetic configurations instead appear together with their spin-density wave like modulations. These all features are well described by S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain under magnetic field."

A phase transition from rhombohedral phase to monoclinic phase was observed for x=0.05-0.1 in (BLEFOx). We have measured phase transition temperatures both alpha-beta transition and low-Temperature (low-T) transitions in doped BiFeO3. The transition peak near to 835C corresponds to alpha to beta-phase transition of BiFeO3 were measured using diffential thermal analysis (DTA). Dielectric measurements shows the low-T transitions in BLEFOx (x = 0.05-0.1). Relatively high remanent magnetization of 0.1178emu/gm at 8T was observed in BLEFOx (x = 0.1)."
1733242,"The perturbation caused by planet-moon binarity on the time-of-arrival signal of a pulsar with an orbiting planet is derived for the case in which the orbits of the moon and the planet-moon barycenter are both circular and coplanar. The signal consists of two sinusoids with frequency (2n_p - 3n_b) and (2n_p - n_b ), where n_p and n_b are the mean motions of the planet and moon around their barycenter, and the planet-moon system around the host, respectively. The amplitude of the signal is equal to the fraction sin I[9(M_p M_m)/16(M_p + M_m)^2] [r/R]^5 of the system crossing time R/c, where M_p and M_m are the the masses of the planet and moon, r is their orbital separation, R is the distance between the host pulsar and planet-moon barycenter, I is the inclination of the orbital plane of the planet, and c is the speed of light. The analysis is applied to the case of PSR B1620-26 b, a pulsar planet, to constrain the orbital separation and mass of any possible moons. We find that a stable moon orbiting this pulsar planet could be detected, if the moon had a separation of about one fiftieth of that of the orbit of the planet around the pulsar, and a mass ratio to the planet of ~5% or larger.

1733243,"Aims. We use the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey to derive the luminosity function (LF) of the first-ranked (brightest) group/cluster galaxies, the LF of second-ranked, satellite and isolated galaxies, and the LF of groups of galaxies. Methods. We investigate the LFs of different samples in various environments: in voids, filaments, superclusters and supercluster cores. We compare the derived LFs with the Schechter and double-power-law analytical expressions. We also analyze the luminosities of isolated galaxies. Results. We find strong environmental dependency of luminosity functions of all populations. The luminosities of first-ranked galaxies have a lower limit, depending on the global environment (higher in supercluster cores, and absent in voids). The LF of second-ranked galaxies in high-density regions is similar to the LF of first-ranked galaxies in a lower-density environment. The brightest isolated galaxies can be identified with first-ranked galaxies at distances where the remaining galaxies lie outside the observational window used in the survey. Conclusions. The galaxy and cluster LFs can be well approximated by a double-power-law; the widely used Schechter function does not describe well the bright end and the bend of the LFs. Properties of the LFs reflect differences in the evolution of galaxies and their groups in different environments. Comment: 15 pages, 19 figures, submitted to A&A"
1733244,"We present a new mechanism for generating primordial statistical anisotropy of curvature perturbations. We introduce a vector field which has a non-minimal kinetic term and couples with a waterfall field in hybrid inflation model. In such a system, the vector field gives fluctuations of the end of inflation and hence induces a subcomponent of curvature perturbations. Since the vector has a preferred direction, the statistical anisotropy could appear in the fluctuations. We present the explicit formula for the statistical anisotropy in the primordial power spectrum and the bispectrum of curvature perturbations. Interestingly, there is the possibility that the statistical anisotropy does not appear in the power spectrum but does appear in the bispectrum. We also find that the statistical anisotropy provides the shape dependence to the bispectrum."
1733245,"A high spatial resolution observation of an emerging flux region (EFR) was made using a vector magnetograph and a Hα Lyot filtergraph with the Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida Observatory on 2006 October 22. In Hα wing images, we could see many Ellerman bombs (EBs) in the EFR. Observations in two modes, slit scan and slit fixed, were performed with the vector magnetograph, along with the Hα filtergraph. Using the Hα wing images, we detected 12 EBs during the slit scan observation period and 9 EBs during the slit fixed observation period. With the slit scan observation, we found that all the EBs were distributed in the area where the spatial gradient of vertical field intensity was large, which indicates the possibility of rapid topological change in the magnetic field in the area of EBs. With the slit fixed observation, we found that EBs were distributed in the areas of undulatory magnetic fields, in both the vertical and horizontal components. This paper is the first to report the undulatory pattern in the horizontal components of the magnetic field, which is also evidence for emerging magnetic flux triggered by the Parker instability. These results allow us to confirm the association between EBs and emerging flux tubes. Three triggering mechanisms for EBs are discussed with respect to emerging flux tubes: 9 out of 21 EBs occurred at the footpoints of emerging flux tubes, 8 occurred at the top of emerging flux tubes, and 4 occurred in the unipolar region. Each case can be explained by magnetic reconnection in the low chromosphere."
1733246,"We study a strong suppression of the relative production rate (d-Au)/(p-p) for inclusive high-pT hadrons of different species at large forward rapidities (large Feynman xF). The model predictions calculated in the light-cone dipole approach are in a good agreement with the recent measurements by the BRAHMS and STAR Collaborations at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. We predict a similar suppression at large pT and large xF also at lower energies, where no effect of coherence is possible. It allows to exclude the saturation models or the models based on Color Glass Condensate from interpretation of nuclear effects."
1733247,"The rotational velocity of distant galaxies, when interpreted as a size (luminosity) indicator, may be used as a tool to select high redshift standard rods (candles) and probe world models and galaxy evolution via the classical angular diameter-redshift or Hubble diagram tests. We implement the proposed testing strategy using a sample of 30 rotators spanning the redshift range 0.2<z<1 with high resolution spectra and images obtained by the VIMOS/VLT Deep Redshift Survey (VVDS) and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODs). We show that by applying at the same time the angular diameter-redshift and Hubble diagrams to the same sample of objects (i.e. velocity selected galactic discs) one can derive a characteristic chart, the cosmology-evolution diagram, mapping the relation between global cosmological parameters and local structural parameters of discs such as size and luminosity. This chart allows to put constraints on cosmological parameters when general prior information about discs evolution is available. In particular, by assuming that equally rotating large discs cannot be less luminous at z=1 than at present (M(z=1) < M(0)), we find that a flat matter dominated cosmology (Omega_m=1) is excluded at a confidence level of 2sigma and an open cosmology with low mass density (Omega_m = 0.3) and no dark energy contribution is excluded at a confidence level greater than 1 sigma. Inversely, by assuming prior knowledge about the cosmological model, the cosmology-evolution diagram can be used to gain useful insights about the redshift evolution of the structural parameters of baryonic discs hosted in dark matter halos of nearly equal masses.

1733248,"We calculate the amount of primordial matter density contrast and the size of the very early universe in the recent Quantum Big Bang theory [arXiv:0705.4549 [gr-qc](2007)] of the cosmological constant.

Harrison-Zel'dovich $k$-dependence with $A = 64/9\pi^2 = 0.72$ and $n = 1$ in $|\delta_k|^2 = Ak^n$ arises inherently. The size of the universe with which it enters the classical Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) phase comes out to be 0.2 cm.

1733250,"We adopt the general formalism for analyzing evolution of gaussian states of quantized fields in time-dependent backgrounds in the Schrodinger picture (presented in detail in Mahajan and Padmanabhan [G. Mahajan, T. Padmanabhan, Gen. Rel. Grav. 40 (2008) 661]) to study the example of a spatially uniform electric field background (in a time-dependent gauge) which is kept turned on for a finite duration of time. In particular, we study the time-dependent particle content, defined in terms of the concept of instantaneous eigenstates, and describe how it captures the time evolution of the quantized field modes. The actual particle creation process occurs over a relatively short interval in time, and the particle content saturates rather quickly. We also compare the power spectrum of the field modes, computed in the asymptotic limit, with the corresponding situation in a cosmological de Sitter background. Particle creation under the influence of a spiked electric field localized in time, as a particular limiting case of the above general model, is also considered."
1733251,A simple expression is obtained for the low temperature behavior of the energy and entropy of finite nuclei for $20\leq A\leq 250$. The dependence on $A$ of these quantities is for the most part due to the presence of the asymmetry energy.
1733252,"Motivated by both experimental and theoretical activities, we discuss the fate of Kondo screening and possible quantum phase transitions in antiferromagnetically ordered phases of Kondo lattices. While transitions with topological changes of the Fermi surface may occur, we demonstrate that an entirely continuous evolution from itinerant to local-moment antiferromagnetism (i.e. from strong to negligible Kondo screening) is possible as well. This situation is in contrast to that in a non-symmetry-broken situation where a quantum phase transition towards an exotic metallic spin-liquid state necessarily accompanies the disappearance of Kondo screening. We discuss criteria for the existence of topological transitions in the antiferromagnetic phase, as well as implications for theoretical scenarios and for current experiments."

After introducing several widely used continuous-time and discrete-time models, we study in detail dependence structures of discrete samples, including Markovian property, hidden Markovian structure, contaminated observations, and random samples. We then discuss several popular parametric and nonparametric estimation methods. To avoid model mis-specification, model validation plays a key role in financial modeling. We discuss several model validation techniques, including pseudo-likelihood ratio test, nonparametric curve regression based test, residuals based test, generalized likelihood ratio test, simultaneous confidence band construction, and density based test. Finally, we briefly touch on tools for studying large sample properties."

1733255,"We develop Yang–Baxter integrability structures connected with the quantum affine superalgebra . Baxter's Q-operators are explicitly constructed as super-traces of certain monodromy matrices associated with (q-deformed) bosonic and fermionic oscillator algebras. There are six different Q-operators in this case, obeying a few fundamental fusion relations, which imply all functional relations between various commuting transfer matrices. The results are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the quantum space of states and apply both to lattice models and to continuous quantum field theory models as well."
1733256,"Discoveries of ratios whose values are constant within broad classes of materials have led to many deep physical insights. The Kadowaki-Woods ratio (KWR) compares the temperature dependence of a metal's resistivity to that of its heat capacity; thereby probing the relationship between the electron-electron scattering rate and the renormalisation of the electron mass. However, the KWR takes very different values in different materials. Here we introduce a ratio, closely related to the KWR, that includes the effects of carrier density and spatial dimensionality and takes the same (predicted) value in organic charge transfer salts, transition metal oxides, heavy fermions and transition metals - despite the numerator and denominator varying by ten orders of magnitude. Hence, in these materials, the same emergent physics is responsible for the mass enhancement and the quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity and no exotic explanations of their KWRs are required.

1733257,"We analyze the quality of the quantum information transmission along a correlated quantum channel by studying the average fidelity between input and output states and the average output purity, giving bounds for the entropy of the channel. Noise correlations in the channel are modeled by the coupling of each channel use with an element of a one dimensional interacting quantum spin chain. Criticality of the environment chain is seen to emerge in the changes of the fidelity and of the purity."
1733258,"We compare the diffraction-limited field of view (FOV) provided by four types of off-axis Gregorian telescopes: the classical Gregorian, the aplanatic Gregorian, and designs that cancel astigmatism and both astigmatism and coma. The analysis is carried out using telescope parameters that are appropriate for satellite and balloon-borne millimeter and sub-millimeter wave astrophysics. We find that the design that cancels both coma and astigmatism provides the largest flat FOV, about 21 square degrees. We also find that the FOV can be increased by about 15% by optimizing the shape and location of the focal surface."
1733259,"We report the first results of quasi-simultaneous two passband optical monitoring of six quasi-stellar objects to search for micro-variability. We carried out photometric monitoring of these sources in an alternating sequence of R and V passbands, for five radio-quiet quasi-stellar objects (RQQSOs), 0748 + 291, 0824 + 098, 0832 + 251, 1101 + 319, 1225 + 317 and one radio-loud quasi-stellar object (RLQSO), 1410 + 429. No micro-variability was detected in any of the RQQSOs, but convincing micro-variability was detected in the RLQSO on two successive nights it was observed. Using the compiled data of optical micro-variability of RQQSOs till date, we got the duty cycle for micro-variability in RQQSOs is ∼10%. The present investigation indicates that micro-variability is not a persistent property of RQQSOs but an occasional incident."
1733260,"The properties of geodesics flow are studied in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric perturbed due to the inhomogeneities of matter. The basic, averaged Jacobi equation is derived, which reveals that the low density regions (voids) are able to induce hyperbolicity, even if the global curvature of the Universe is zero or slightly positive. It is shown that the energy independence is a characteristic property of these geometric effects. The importance of these conclusions is determined by the temperature independent ellipticity of excursion sets and regions of different randomness found in Kolmogorov CMB maps.

1733261,"For a given bi-continuous semigroup T on a Banach space X we define its adjoint on an appropriate closed subspace X^o of the norm dual X'. Under some abstract conditions this adjoint semigroup is again bi-continuous with respect to the weak topology (X^o,X). An application is the following: For K a Polish space we consider operator semigroups on the space C(K) of bounded, continuous functions (endowed with the compact-open topology) and on the space M(K) of bounded Baire measures (endowed with the weak*-topology). We show that bi-continuous semigroups on M(K) are precisely those that are adjoints of a bi-continuous semigroups on C(K). We also prove that the class of bi-continuous semigroups on C(K) with respect to the compact-open topology coincides with the class of equicontinuous semigroups with respect to the strict topology. In general, if K is not Polish space this is not the case."
1733262,"In the multiple-soliton case, the freedom in the expansion of the solution of the perturbed KdV equation is exploited so as to transform the equation into a system of two equations: The (inte-grable) Normal Form for KdV-type solitons, which obey the usual infinity of KdV-conservation laws, and an auxiliary equation that describes the contribution of obstacles to asymptotic inte-grability, which arise from the second order onwards. The analysis has been carried through the third order in the expansion. Within that order, the solution of the auxiliary equation is a con-served quantity."

The analysis reveals strong (turbulencelike) intermittency of the flux dissipation rate for short-term intervals: 1\char21{}30 h. It is also found that the type of intermittency can be different in different energy ranges."
1733264,"We introduce a ray class invariant X(\mathfrakC){X(\mathfrak{C})} for a totally real field, following Shintani’s work in the real quadratic case. We prove a factorization formula X(\mathfrakC)=X1(\mathfrakC)¼Xn(\mathfrakC){X(\mathfrak{C})=X_1(\mathfrak{C})\cdots X_n(\mathfrak{C})} where each Xi(\mathfrakC){X_i(\mathfrak{C})} corresponds to a real place. Although this factorization depends a priori on some choices (especially on a cone decomposition), we can show that it is actually independent of these choices. Finally, we describe the behavior of Xi(\mathfrakC){X_i(\mathfrak{C})} when the signature of \mathfrakC{\mathfrak{C}} at a real place is changed. This last result is also interpreted in terms of the derivatives L′(0, χ) of the L-functions and certain Stark units."
1733265,"We present briefly a theoretical model of viscous friction in foams and concentrated emulsions, subject to steady shear deformation. In this model we calculate (1) energy dissipated inside the planar films between two neighboring bubbles/drops, which slide along each other dragged by the flow, and (2) energy dissipated on the surface of the bubbles/drops, as a result of their deformation in the flow. Next, from the calculated dissipated energy we determine the macroscopic viscous stress of the sheared foam/emulsion. The model predictions agree well with various experimental data."
1733266,"The DC charge current, field-induced spin polarization and spin textures are studied in the 1D gated superlattice with both fixed and varying Rashba and Dresselhaus contributions to spin-orbit coupling. It is found that a spin component with zero mean value can demonstrate non-vanishing field-induced spin texture in a superlattice cell which can be probed experimentally, with the highest amplitudes achievable in an interval of comparable Rashba and Dresselhaus terms. The consideration of the finite parameters for collision rate and temperature is found to be non-destructive for the calculated current and spin characteristics depending on all states below the Fermi level."

It is shown that these graphs are relatively robust. The nonrandom node removal process of targeted attacks is also investigated as a special case of non-uniform site percolation. Critical exponents are calculated by measuring various properties of the distribution of percolation clusters. They are found to be roughly compatible with critical exponents of uniform percolation on these graphs."
1733268,"We investigate properties of the reconnecting current layer in relativistic pair plasma reconnection. We found that the current layer self-regulates its thickness when the current layer runs out current carriers, and so relativistic reconnection retains a fast reconnection rate. Constructing a steady state Sweet-Parker model, we discuss conditions for the current sheet expansion. Based on the energy argument, we conclude that the incompressible assumption is invalid in relativistic Sweet-Parker reconnection. The guide field cases are more incompressible than the anti-parallel cases, and we find a more significant current sheet expansion."
1733269,"Stationary and axisymmetric ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion onto a black hole is studied analytically. The accreting plasma ejected from a plasma source with low velocity must be super-fast magnetosonic before passing through the event horizon. We work out and apply a trans-fast magnetosonic solution without the detailed analysis of the regularity conditions at the magnetosonic point, by introducing the bending angle $\beta$ of magnetic field line, which is the ratio of the toroidal and poloidal components of the magnetic field. To accrete onto a black hole, the trans-magnetosonic solution has some restrictions on $\beta$, which are related to the field-aligned parameters of the MHD flows. One of the restrictions gives the boundary condition at the event horizon for the inclination of a magnetic field line. We find that this inclination is related to the energy and angular momentum transport to the black hole. Then, we discuss the spin-up/down process of a rotating black hole by cold MHD inflows in a secular evolution timescale. There are two asymptotic states for the spin evolution. One is that the angular velocity of the black hole approaches to that of the magnetic field line, and the other is that the spin-up effect by the positive angular momentum influx and the spin-down effect by the energy influx (as the mass-energy influx) are canceled. We also show that the MHD inflows prevents the evolution to the maximally rotating black hole."
1733270,"We review our Al adsorption experiments on the tenfold-symmetry surface of the decagonal Al-Co-Ni quasicrystal and present computational simulations of adsorption on a structural model based on a fundamental Al-Co cluster with 20 \AA diameter, symmetry $\bar{10}2m$, and 8 \AA periodicity. This cluster is the building unit of $\tau ^2$-Al$_{13}$Co$_4$, from which, by a sequence of minor changes, the structures of the phases in the stability region of decagonal Al-Co-Ni can be derived. The model used for the decagonal Al$_{70}$Co$_{15}$Ni$_{15}$ is an idealized model with a two-layer periodicity (4 \AA) and no chemical or structural disorder. We find that the bulk and surface properties of this model are in good agreement with experiments. Our molecular-dynamics simulations of Al adsorption reproduce the experimental results and show that by varying the thermal relaxation rates of the adsorbed layer, a variety of different surface morphologies can be achieved. We also present our recent experiments on dissociative adsorption of oxygen on the decagonal surface. Comment: 21 pages, 10 figures. To appear in the Quasicrystals at Interfaces issue of J. Phys.

1733271,"Our simultaneous multicolor (UBVRI) circular polarimetry has revealed nearly sinusoidal variation over the WD spin cycle, and almost symmetric positive and negative polarization excursions. Maximum amplitudes are observed in the B and V bands (+-3 %). This is the first time that polarization peaking in the blue has been discovered in an IP, and suggests that V405 Aur is the highest magnetic field IP found so far. The polarized flux spectrum is similar to those found in polars with magnetic fields in the range B ~ 25-50 MG. Our low resolution circular spectropolarimetry has given evidence of transient features which can be fitted by cyclotron harmonics n = 6, 7, and 8, at a field of B = 31.5 +- 0.8 MG, consistent with the broad-band polarized flux spectrum. Timings of the circular polarization zero crossovers put strict upper limits on WD spin period changes and indicate that the WD in V405 Aur is currently accreting closely at the spin equilibrium rate, with very long synchronization timescales, T_s > 10^9 yr. For the observed spin to orbital period ratio, P_{spin}/P_{orb} = 0.0365, and P_{orb} ~ 4.15 hr, existing numerical accretion models predict spin equilibrium condition with B ~ 30 MG if the mass ratio of the binary components is q_1 ~ 0.4. The high magnetic field makes V405 Aur a likely candidate as a progenitor of a polar. Comment: To appear in The Astrophysical Journal, September 1 Issue (2008), 9 pages, 10 figures"

1733274,"We consider a graph polynomial \xi(G;x,y,z) introduced by Averbouch, Godlin, and Makowsky (2007). This graph polynomial simultaneously generalizes the Tutte polynomial as well as a bivariate chromatic polynomial defined by Dohmen, Poenitz and Tittmann (2003). We derive an identity which relates the graph polynomial of a thicked graph (i.e. a graph with each edge replaced by k copies of it) to the graph polynomial of the original graph. As a consequence, we observe that at every point (x,y,z), except for points lying within some set of dimension 2, evaluating \xi is #P-hard."
1733275,"Violent relaxation during the collapse of a galaxy halo is known to be incomplete in realistic cases such as cosmological infall or mergers. We adopt a physical picture of strong but short lived interactions between potential fluctuations and particle orbits, using the broad framework outlined by Tremaine (1987) for incorporating incompleteness of the relaxation. We are guided by results from plasma physics, viz. the quasilinear theory of Landau damping, but allow for significant differences in our case. Crucially, wave particle scattering does not drive the system to an equilibrium distribution function of the exponential type, even in regions of phase space allowed by the constraints. The physical process is mixing without friction in ``action'' space, for which the simplest possible model is a constant phase space density modulated by the constraints. Our distribution function does not use the exponential functions of the energy prevalent in other work, which we regard as inappropriate to collisionless systems. The halo of the self-consistent, parameter-free solutions show an r^(-4) behavior in density at large r, an r^(1/4) surface brightness profile in the region 0.1-8 r_e, and a radially anisotropic velocity dispersion profile outside an isotropic core. The energy distribution seen in simulations N(E) singles out the pericenter cutoff model as the most realistic among the variants we have explored.

1733277,"We have detected redshifted CO (2-1) emission at 43 GHz and radio continuum emission at 1.47 and 4.86 GHz from the z = 4.4 QSO BRI 1335-0417 using the Very Large Array. The CO data imply optically thick emission from warm (>30 K) molecular gas with a total mass, M(H_2), of 1.5+/-0.3 x10^{11} M_solar, using the Galactic gas mass-to-CO luminosity conversion factor. We set an upper limit to the CO source size of 1.1"", and a lower limit of 0.23""x(T_ex/50K)^{-1/2}, where T_ex is the gas excitation temperature. We derive an upper limit to the dynamical mass of 2x10^{10} x sin^{-2} i M_solar, where i is the disk inclination angle. To reconcile the gas mass with the dynamical mass requires either a nearly face-on disk (i < 25deg), or a gas mass-to-CO luminosity conversion factor significantly lower than the Galactic value. The spectral energy distribution from the radio to the rest-frame infrared of BRI 1335-0417 is consistent with that expected from a nuclear starburst galaxy, with an implied massive star formation rate of 2300+/-600 M_solar yr^{-1}.

1733280,This article describes an approach to designing a distributed and modular neural classifier. This approach introduces a new hierarchical clustering that enables one to determine reliable regions in the representation space by exploiting supervised information. A multilayer perceptron is then associated with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular classifiers are given.
1733281,"We discuss how Raman spectra are affected by nearly-critical spin and charge collective modes, which are coupled to charge carriers near a stripe quantum critical point. We show that specific fingerprints of nearly-critical collective modes can indeed be observed in Raman spectra and that the selectivity of Raman spectroscopy in momentum space may also be exploited to distinguish the spin and charge contribution. We apply our results to discuss the spectra of high-Tc superconducting cuprates finding that the collective modes should have masses with substantial temperature dependence in agreement with their nearly critical character. Moreover spin modes should be more diffusive than charge modes indicating that in stripes the charge is nearly ordered, while spin modes are strongly overdamped and fluctuate with high frequency.

1733282,"The dileptonic decays of doubly-charged Higgs bosons H±± are investigated in the minimal type-II seesaw model with one Higgs triplet Δ and one heavy Majorana neutrino N1 at the TeV scale. We show that the branching ratios depend not only on the mass and mixing parameters of three light neutrinos νi (for i=1,2,3), but also on those of N1. Assuming the mass of N1 to lie in the range 200 GeV–1 TeV, we figure out the generous interference bands for the contributions of νi and N1 to : , where θi4 and θj4 measure the strength of charged-current interactions of N1. We illustrate some salient features of the interference bands by considering three typical mass patterns of νi, and stress that it is very difficult to distinguish the type-II seesaw model from the triplet seesaw model in such a parameter region at the Large Hadron Collider."
1733283,We report Nernst effect measurements for some crystalline films of Ca and Zn-doped yttrium barium copper oxide grown by pulsed laser deposition. We argue that our results and most of the published data for LSCO are consistent with the theory of Gaussian superconducting fluctuations.
1733284,The radiation broadening of narrow maser lines by its own emission which can be described as resonance Self-Stark effect puts an upper limit on the brightness temperature of cosmic masers. It is shown that available results of measurements of the brightness temperature of OH and water masers are consistent with the observed narrow line widths only if the maser emission is highly directive.
1733285,"We consider an ensemble of quantum systems described by a density matrix, solution of a Lindblad-Kossakowski differential equation. We focus on the special case where the decoherence is only due to a highly unstable excited state and where the spontaneously emitted photons are measured by a photo-detector. We propose a systematic method to eliminate the fast and asymptotically stable dynamics associated with the excited state in order to obtain another differential equation for the slow part. We show that this slow differential equation is still of Lindblad-Kossakowski type, that the decoherence terms and the measured output depend explicitly on the amplitudes of quasi-resonant applied field, i.e., the control. Beside a rigorous proof of the slow/fast (adiabatic) reduction based on singular perturbation theory, we also provide a physical interpretation of the result in the context of coherence population trapping via dark states and decoherence-free subspaces. Numerical simulations illustrate the accuracy of the proposed approximation for a 5-level systems."
1733286,"Fast sweep projection onto Feshbach molecules has been widely used as a probe to explore the properties of fermionic condensates, in particular the condensate fraction. By determining the exact dynamics of a pair of atoms in time varying magnetic fields across a Feshbach resonance, we calculate the number of condensed and noncondensed molecules created after fast magnetic field sweeps from the BCS to the BEC side of the resonance. We analyse the dependence of the molecular conversion efficiency for condensed and noncondensed molecules on the sweep rate, and on the initial and final magnetic fields, for $^{40}$K and $^{6}$Li resonances; and discuss the relation between the initial fermionic condensate fraction and the molecular condensate fraction measured after the sweep."
1733287,"Aims: We aim to achieve high spatial resolution as well as high polarimetric sensitivity, using an earth-based 1m-class solar telescope, for the study of magnetic fine structure on the Sun. Methods: We use a setup with 3 high-speed, low-noise cameras to construct datasets with interleaved polarimetric states, particularly suitable for Multi-Object Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution image restorations. We discuss the polarimetric calibration routine as well as various potential sources of error in the results. Results: We obtained near diffraction limited images, with a noise level of approximately 10^(-3) I(cont). We confirm that dark-cores have a weaker magnetic field and at a lower inclination angle with respect to the solar surface than the edges of the penumbral filament.

1733288,"Aims. The JK = 10−0_0 rotational transition of phosphine (PH_3) at 267 GHz has been tentatively identified with a TMB ~ 40 mK spectral line observed with the IRAM 30-m telescope in the C-star envelope IRC +10216. Methods. A radiative transfer model was used to fit the observed line profile. Results. The derived PH_3 abundance relative to H_2 is 6 × 10^−9, although it may have a large uncertainty due to the lack of knowledge about the spatial distribution of this species. If our identification is correct, it implies that PH3 has a similar abundance to what is reported for HCP in this source and that these two molecules (HCP and PH_3) together take up about 5% of phosphorus in IRC +10216. The abundance of PH_3, like that of other hydrides in this source, is not well explained by conventional gas-phase LTE and non-LTE chemical models, and may imply formation on grain surfaces."
1733289,"We investigate, at both zero and finite temperature, the properties of strangelets versus the electric charge Z and strangeness S. The strangelet radius is not a monotonic function of either charge or strangeness, and a minimum is reached in the (Z, S) plane. However, the thermodynamically stable strangelets do not correspond to the radius minimum. The minimum radius always appears at positive strangeness, while the stable radius may appear at negative strangeness for very small baryon numbers. For large baryon numbers, the stable radius is proportional to the cubic root of baryon numbers, but inversely proportional to the square root of the confinement parameter in the present model. If bulk strange quark matter is absolutely stable, the reduced size of strangelets is about 1 fm, which may be relevant for the analysis of the strangelet production and detection."
1733290,"We demonstrate that the large scatter in the ultraviolet (UV) colours of intermediate-mass early-type galaxies in the local Universe and the inferred low-level recent star formation (RSF) in these objects can be reproduced by minor mergers in the standard Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. Numerical simulations of mergers with mass ratios ≤1:4, with reasonable assumptions for the ages, metallicities and dust properties of the merger progenitors, produce good agreement with the observed UV colours of the early-type population, if the infalling satellites are assumed to have (cold) gas fractions ≥20 per cent. Early-types that satisfy (NUV−r) ≲ 3.8 are likely to have experienced mergers with mass ratios between 1:4 and 1:6 within the last ∼1.5 Gyr, while those that satisfy 3.8 < (NUV−r) < 5.5 are consistent with either recent mergers with mass ratios ≤1:6 or mergers with higher mass ratios that occurred more than ∼1.5 Gyr in the past. We demonstrate that the early-type colour–magnitude relations and colour distributions, in both the UV and optical spectral ranges, are consistent with the expected frequency of minor merging activity in the standard ΛCDM cosmology at low redshift. We present a strong plausibility argument for minor mergers to be the principal mechanism behind the large UV scatter and associated low-level RSF observed in early-type galaxies in the nearby Universe."
1733291,"We consider the first Weyl algebra, A, in the Euler gradation, and completely classify graded rings B that are graded equivalent to A: that is, the categories gr-A and gr-B are equivalent. This includes some surprising examples: in particular, we show that A is graded equivalent to an idealizer in a localization of A.We obtain this classification as an application of a general Morita-type characterization of equivalences of graded module categories. Given a Z-graded ring R, an autoequivalence F of gr-R, and a finitely generated graded projective right R-module P, we show how to construct a twisted endomorphism ring and prove:Theorem. TheZ-graded rings R and S are graded equivalent if and only if there are an autoequivalenceFofgr-Rand a finitely generated graded projective right R-module P such that the modules{FnP}generategr-Rand."
1733292,"Following the outburst of the unusual variable star V838 Monocerotis in 2002, a spectacular light echo appeared. A light echo provides the possibility of direct geometric distance determination, because it should contain a ring of highly linearly polarized light at a linear radius of ct, where t is the time since the outburst. We present imaging polarimetry of the V838 Mon light echo, obtained in 2002 and 2005 with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope, which confirms the presence of the highly polarized ring. Based on detailed modeling that takes into account the outburst light curve, the paraboloidal echo geometry, and the physics of dust scattering and polarization, we find a distance of 6.1 ± 0.6 kpc. The error is dominated by the systematic uncertainty in the scattering angle of maximum linear polarization, taken to be θmax = 90° ± 5°. The polarimetric distance agrees remarkably well with a distance of 6.2 ± 1.2 kpc obtained from the entirely independent method of main-sequence fitting to a sparse star cluster associated with V838 Mon. At this distance, V838 Mon at maximum light had MV −9.8, making it temporarily one of the most luminous stars in the Local Group. Our validation of the polarimetric method offers promise for measurement of extragalactic distances using supernova light echoes."
1733293,"The first realization of a polariton condensate was recently achieved in a CdTe microcavity [Kasprzak et al., Nature 443, 409 (2006)]. We compare the experimental phase boundaries, for various detunings and cryostat temperatures, with those found theoretically from a model which accounts for features of microcavity polaritons such as reduced dimensionality, internal composite structure, disorder in the quantum wells, polariton-polariton interactions, and finite lifetime."
1733294,"In the mean-field limit the dynamics of a quantum Bose gas is described by a Hartree equation. We present a simple method for proving the convergence of the microscopic quantum dynamics to the Hartree dynamics when the number of particles becomes large and the strength of the two-body potential tends to 0 like the inverse of the particle number. Our method is applicable for a class of singular interaction potentials including the Coulomb potential. We prove and state our main result for the Heisenberg-picture dynamics of ""observables"", thus avoiding the use of coherent states. Our formulation shows that the mean-field limit is a ""semi-classical"" limit. Comment: Corrected typos and included an elementary proof of the Kato smoothing estimate (Lemma 6.1)"
1733295,"The construction of perfect hash functions is a well-studied topic. In this paper, this concept is generalized with the following definition. We say that a family of functions from $[n]$ to $[k]$ is a $\delta$-balanced $(n,k)$-family of perfect hash functions if for every $S \subseteq [n]$, $|S|=k$, the number of functions that are 1-1 on $S$ is between $T/\delta$ and $\delta T$ for some constant $T>0$. The standard definition of a family of perfect hash functions requires that there will be at least one function that is 1-1 on $S$, for each $S$ of size $k$. In the new notion of balanced families, we require the number of 1-1 functions to be almost the same (taking $\delta$ to be close to 1) for every such $S$. Our main result is that for any constant $\delta > 1$, a $\delta$-balanced $(n,k)$-family of perfect hash functions of size $2^{O(k \log \log k)} \log n$ can be constructed in time $2^{O(k \log \log k)} n \log n$. Using the technique of color-coding we can apply our explicit constructions to devise approximation algorithms for various counting problems in graphs. In particular, we exhibit a deterministic polynomial time algorithm for approximating both the number of simple paths of length $k$ and the number of simple cycles of size $k$ for any $k \leq O(\frac{\log n}{\log \log \log n})$ in a graph with $n$ vertices. The approximation is up to any fixed desirable relative error."
1733296,"In a number of model contexts, evolution across space-time singularities (reminiscent of the cosmological singularities) involves time-dependent quantum Hamiltonians developing a singularity as a function of time.

1733297,"There are two ways of counting microscopic states of black holes in loop quantum gravity, one counting all allowed spin network labels $j,m$ and the other involving only the labels $m$. Counting states with $|m|=j$, as done in a recent Letter, does not follow either."
1733298,"We consider a long-range Ising antiferromagnet (LRIAF) put in a transverse field. Applying quantum Monte Carlo method, we study the variation of order parameter (spin correlation in Trotter time direction), susceptibility and average energy of the system for various values of the transverse field at different temperatures. The antiferromagnetic order is seen to get immediately broken as soon as the thermal or quantum fluctuations are added. We also discuss the phase diagram for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with the same LRIAF bias, also in presence of a transverse field. We find that while the antiferromagnetic order is immediately broken as one adds an infinitesimal transverse field or thermal fluctuation to the system, an infinitesimal SK spin glass disorder is enough to induce a stable glass order in the antiferromagnet. This glass order eventually gets destroyed as the thermal or quantum fluctuations increased beyond their threshold values and the transition to para phase occurs. Indications of this novel phase transition are discussed. Because of the presence of full frustration, this surrogate property of the LRIAF for incubation of stable spin glass phase in it (induced by addition of a small disorder) should enable eventually the study of classical and quantum spin glass phases by using some perturbation theory with respect to the disorder.

1733299,"Searching for the Ultra high energy Cosmic rays and Neutrinos of $> 10^{20} eV$ is of great cosmological importance. A powerful technique is to search for the \v{C}erenkov radio emission caused by UHECR or UHE neutrinos impinging on the lunar regolith. We examine in this paper feasibility of detecting these events by observing with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) which has a large collecting area and operates over a wide frequency range with an orthogonal polarisation capability. We discuss here prospects of observations of the \v{C}erenkov radio emission with the GMRT at 140 MHZ with 32 MHz bandwidth using the incoherent array and also forming 25 beams of the Central Array to cover the moon. We also consider using the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT) which was specially designed in 1970 for tracking the Moon. With the ORT (530m long and 30m wide parabolic cylinder) it becomes possible to track the Moon for 9.5 hours on a given day by a simple rotation along the long axis of the parabolic cylinder. ORT operates at 325 MHz and has an effective collecting area of ~ 8000 $m^2.$ Recently a digital system has been installed by scientists of the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bangalore and the Radio Astronomy Centre (RAC) of NCRA/TIFR, at Ooty allowing a bandwidth of 10 MHz with ~ 40 ns sampling. It is possible to form 6 beams covering the Moon and 7th beam far away for discrimination of any terrestrial RFI. Increasing the bandwidth of the existing 12 beam analogue system of the ORT from 4 MHz to 15 MHz to be sampled digitally is planned. It is shown that by observing the Moon for $\ge$ 1000 hrs using the ORT it will provide appreciably higher sensitivity than past searches made elsewhere. Using the GMRT and ORT, it may be possible to reach sensitivity to test the Waxman-Bachall limit on UHE neutrino flux."
1733300,"Analogous to cuprate high-Tc superconductors, a NiP-based compound system has several crystals in which the Ni–P layers have different stacking structures. Herein, the properties of BaNi2P2 are reported. BaNi2P2 has an infinite-layer structure, and shows a superconducting transition at ∼3 K. Moreover, it exhibits metallic conduction and Pauli paramagnetism in the temperature range of 4–300 K. Below 3 K, the resistivity sharply drops to zero, and the magnetic susceptibility becomes negative, while the volume fraction of the superconducting phase estimated from the diamagnetic susceptibility reaches ∼100 vol.% at 1.9 K. These observations substantiate that BaNi2P2 is a bulk superconductor."
1733301,"In this paper we consider the possible existence of unstable axisymmetric modes in Kerr spacetimes, resulting from exponentially growing solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We describe a transformation that casts the radial equation that results upon separation of variables in the Teukolsky equation, in the form of a Schrödinger equation, and combine the properties of the solutions of this equations with some recent results on the asymptotic behaviour of spin weighted spheroidal harmonics to prove the existence of an infinite family of unstable modes. Thus we prove that the stationary region beyond a Kerr black hole inner horizon is unstable under gravitational linear perturbations. We also prove that Kerr spacetime with angular momentum larger than its square mass, which has a naked singularity, is unstable."

The object has been extensively monitored with the University of Durham Mark 6 telescope. Results of observations, including those taken in 1998 and 1999, are reported. There is no evidence for time variability in all the VHE data. There is also no evidence for correlation of the VHE flux with the X-ray flux detected by BATSE and RXTE/ASM. A search for periodic emission, at or close to the X-ray spin period, in the VHE data yielded a 3 sigma upper limit to the pulsed flux of 2.0 x 10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1."
1733303,"A programme of detailed simulations of the response of the Durham Mark 6 atmospheric Cherenkov telescope is in progress.

1733307,"We have studied current-driven domain wall motion in modified Ga_0.95Mn_0.05As Hall bar structures with perpendicular anisotropy by using spatially resolved Polar Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect Microscopy and micromagnetic simulation. Regardless of the initial magnetic configuration, the domain wall propagates in the opposite direction to the current with critical current of 1~2x10^5A/cm^2. Considering the spin transfer torque term as well as various effective magnetic field terms, the micromagnetic simulation results are consistent with the experimental results. Our simulated and experimental results suggest that the spin-torque rather than Oersted field is the reason for current driven domain wall motion in this material.

1733308,"We consider Kerr spacetimes with parameters a and M such that |a|<< M, Kerr-Newman spacetimes with parameters |Q|<< M, |a|<< M, and more generally, stationary axisymmetric black hole exterior spacetimes which are sufficiently close to a Schwarzschild metric with parameter M>0, with appropriate geometric assumptions on the plane spanned by the Killing fields. We show uniform boundedness on the exterior for sufficiently regular solutions to the scalar homogeneous wave equation. In particular, the bound holds up to and including the event horizon. No unphysical restrictions are imposed on the behaviour of the solution near the bifurcation surface of the event horizon. The pointwise estimate derives in fact from the uniform boundedness of a positive definite energy flux. Note that in view of the very general assumptions, the separability properties of the wave equation on the Kerr background are not used."
1733309,"We present a new integrable partial differential equation found by Vladimir Novikov. Like the Camassa-Holm and Degasperis-Procesi equations, this new equation admits peaked soliton (peakon) solutions, but it has nonlinear terms that are cubic, rather than quadratic. We give a matrix Lax pair for V Novikov's equation, and show how it is related by a reciprocal transformation to a negative flow in the Sawada-Kotera hierarchy. Infinitely many conserved quantities are found, as well as a bi-Hamiltonian structure. The latter is used to obtain the Hamiltonian form of the finite-dimensional system for the interaction of N peakons, and the two-body dynamics (N = 2) is explicitly integrated. Finally, all of this is compared with some analogous results for another cubic peakon equation derived by Zhijun Qiao."
1733310,"Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we investigate the influence of polymer-pore interactions on the dynamics of biopolymer translocation through nanopores. We find that an attractive interaction can significantly change the translocation dynamics. This can be understood by examining the three components of the total translocation time tau approximately tau1+tau2+tau3 corresponding to the initial filling of the pore, transfer of polymer from the cis side to the trans side, and emptying of the pore, respectively. We find that the dynamics for the last process of emptying of the pore changes from nonactivated to activated in nature as the strength of the attractive interaction increases, and tau3 becomes the dominant contribution to the total translocation time for strong attraction. This leads to nonuniversal dependence of tau as a function of driving force and chain length. Our results are in good agreement with recent experimental findings, and provide a plausible explanation for the different scaling behavior observed in solid state nanopores vs that for the natural alpha-hemolysin channel."
1733311,"We determine the scaling exponents of polymer translocation (PT) through a nanopore by extensive computer simulations of various microscopic models for chain lengths extending up to N=800 in some cases.

We find alpha=1+2nu and beta=2/alpha for unbiased PT in two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions (3D). The relation alphabeta=2 holds for driven PT in 2D, with a crossover from alpha approximately 2nu for short chains to alpha approximately 1+nu for long chains. This crossover is, however, absent in 3D where alpha=1.42+/-0.01 and alphabeta approximately 2.2 for N approximately 40-800."
1733312,"At present it is generally believed that ``new physics'' effects contribute to leptonic anomalous magnetic moment, a_l, via quantum loops only and they are proportional to the squared lepton mass, (m_l)^2. An alternative mechanism for a contribution by new physics is proposed. It occurs at the tree level and exhibits a linear rather than quadratic dependence on m_l. This leads to a much larger sensitivity of a_e to the new physics than was expected so far."
1733313,"LISA is a joint space mission of the NASA and the ESA for detecting low frequency gravitational waves in the band $10^{-5} - 1$ Hz. In order to attain the requisite sensitivity for LISA, the laser frequency noise must be suppressed below the other secondary noises such as the optical path noise, acceleration noise etc. This is achieved by combining time-delayed data for which precise knowledge of time-delays is required. The gravitational field, mainly that of the Sun and the motion of LISA affect the time-delays and the optical links. Further, the effect of the gravitational field of the Earth on the orbits of spacecraft is included. This leads to additional flexing over and above that of the Sun. We have written a numerical code which computes the optical links, that is, the time-delays with great accuracy $\sim 10^{-2}$ metres - more than what is required for time delay interferometry (TDI) - for most of the orbit and with sufficient accuracy within $\sim 10$ metres for an integrated time window of about six days, when one of the arms tends to be tangent to the orbit. Our analysis of the optical links is fully general relativistic and the numerical code takes into account effects such as the Sagnac, Shapiro delay, etc.. We show that with the deemed parameters in the design of LISA, there are symmetries inherent in the configuration of LISA and in the physics, which may be used effectively to suppress the residual laser noise in the modified first generation TDI. We demonstrate our results for some important TDI variables."
1733314,The length of coding sequence series in microbial genomes were regarded as a fluctuating system and characterized by the methods of statistical physics. The distribution and the correlatin properties of 50 genomes including bacteria and several archaea were investigated. The distribution was investigated by rank-size analysis (Zipf's law. We found that coding sequence lengths series do not obey Zipf's law contrary to natural languages. The distribution was found to be more closely to an exponential distribution. The correlation appeared to be similar to natural languages. Segmentation analysis of the series showed to be short range memory systems.
1733315,"The spectral evolution of powerful double radio galaxies (FR II's) is thought to be determined by the acceleration of electrons at the termination shock of the jet, their transport through the bright head region into the lobes and the production of the radio emission by synchrotron radiation in the lobes. Models presented to date incorporate some of these processes in prescribing the electron distribution which enters the lobes. We have extended these models to include a description of electron acceleration at the relativistic termination shock and a selection of transport models for the head region. These are coupled to the evolution of the electron spectrum in the lobes under the influence of losses due to adiabatic expansion, by inverse Compton scattering on the cosmic background radiation and by synchrotron radiation. The evolutionary tracks predicted by this model are compared to observation using the power/source-size (P-D) diagram. We find that the simplest scenario, in which accelerated particles suffer adiabatic losses in the head region which become more severe as the source expands produces P-D-tracks which conflict with observation, because the power is predicted to decline too steeply with increasing size. Agreement with observation can be found by assuming that adiabatic losses are compensated during transport between the termination shock and the lobe by a re-acceleration process distributed throughout the head region.

1733316,"I compare two quantum-theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of adaptive mutations, termed here Q-cell and Q-genome. I use 'fluctuation trapping' model as a general framework. I introduce notions of R-error and D-error and argue that the 'fluctuation trapping' model has to employ a correlation between the R- and D- errors. Further, I compare how the two approaches can justify the R-D-error correlation, focusing on the advantages of the Q-cell approach. The positive role of environmentally induced decoherence (EID) on both steps of the adaptation process is emphasized. A starving bacterial cell is proposed to be in an einselected state. The intracellular dynamics in this state has a unitary character and I propose to interpret it as 'exponential growth in imaginary time', analogously to the commonly considered 'diffusion' interpretation of the Schroedinger equation. Addition of a substrate leads to Wick rotation and a switch from 'imaginary time' reproduction to a 'real time' reproduction regime. Due to the variations at the genomic level (such as base tautomery), the starving cell has to be represented as a superposition of different components, all 'reproducing in imaginary time'. Adidtion of a selective substrate, allowing only one of these components to amplify, will cause Wick rotation and amplification of this component, thus justifying the occurence of the R-D-error correlation. Further ramifications of the proposed ideas for evolutionary theory are discussed. Comment: 35 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, 1 Appendix. This version was accepted in the NeuroQuantology Journal.

1733317,"We present our recent results on the temperature dependence of current-voltage characteristics for polycrystalline Y1-xPrxBa2Cu3O7- superconductors with x = 0.0, 0.1 and 0.3. The experimental results are found to be reasonably well fitted for all samples by a power like law of the form . Here, we assume that a(T)=1+0IC(T)/2kBT and IC(T)=IC(0)(1-T/TC)3/2 for the temperature dependences of the power exponent and critical current, respectively. According to the theoretical interpretation of the obtained results, nonlinear deviation of our current-voltage characteristics curves from Ohmic behavior (with a(TC)=1) below TC is attributed to the manifestation of dissipation processes. They have a characteristic temperature Tp defined via the power exponent as a(Tp)=2 and are related to the current induced depinning of Abrikosov vortices. Both TC(x) and Tp(x) are found to decrease with an increase of Pr concentration x reflecting deterioration of the superconducting properties of the doped samples."
1733318,"The Equal Filling Approximation, a procedure widely used in mean field calculations to treat the dynamics of odd nuclei in a time reversal invariant way, is justified as the consequence of a variational principle over an average energy functional. The ideas of Statistical Quantum Mechanics are employed in the justification. As an illustration of the method, the ground and lowest lying states of some octupole deformed Radium isotopes are computed."

1733321,"Hydrodynamic slip of Newtonian liquids is a new phenomenon, the origin of which is not yet clarified. There are various direct and indirect techniques to measure slippage. Here we describe a method to characterize the influence of slippage on the shape of rims surrounding growing holes in thin polymer films. Atomic force microscopy is used to study the shape of the rim; by analyzing its profile and applying an appropriate lubrication model we are able to determine the slip length for polystyrene films. In the experiments we study polymer films below the entanglement length that dewet from hydrophobized (silanized) surfaces. We show that the slip length at the solid/liquid interface increases with increasing viscosity. The correlation between viscosity and slip length is dependent on the type of silanization. This indicates a link between the molecular mechanism of the interaction of polymer chains and silane molecules under flow conditions that we will discuss in detail."
1733322,"Li et al. presented a protocol [International Journal of Quantum Information 4(6) (2006) 899–906] for quantum key distribution based on entanglement swapping. In this protocol, they use random and certain bits to construct a classical key, and they claim that this key is secure. In our article, we show that the protocol by Li et al. is insecure, presenting a new type of attack strategy which gives an adversary full information about the key without being detected. This strategy is based on entanglement swapping, too, and manages to preserve the correlation between the measurement results of the legitimate parties. Further, we present a modified version of the protocol and show that it is secure against this new attack strategy."
1733323,"This work aims to constrain the physical nature of umbral dots (UDs) using high-resolution spectropolarimetry. Full Stokes spectra recorded by the spectropolarimeter on Hinode of 51 UDs in a sunspot close to the disk center are analyzed. The height dependence of the temperature, magnetic field vector, and line-of-sight velocity across each UD is obtained from an inversion of the Stokes vectors of the two FeI lines at 630 nm. No difference is found at higher altitudes (-3 <= log(tau) <= -2) between the UDs and the diffuse umbral background. Below that level the difference rapidly increases, so that at the continuum formation level (log(tau) = 0) we find on average a temperature enhancement of 570 K, a magnetic field weakening of 510 G, and upflows of 800 m/s for peripheral UDs, whereas central UDs display an excess temperature of on average 550 K, a field weakening of 480 G, and no significant upflows. The results for, in particular, the peripheral UDs, including cuts of magnetic vector and velocity through them, look remarkably similar to the output of recent radiation MHD simulations. They strongly suggest that UDs are produced by convective upwellings."
1733324,"It is shown that a sufficiently strong external electric field causes a decrease in the transition temperature of ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and metal-insulator transitions. The temperature dependence of the critical electric field suppressing a low-temperature phase is obtained. The relation between the low-temperature charge gap (the band gap) in the insulating phase and the metal-insulator transition temperature is also inferred."
1733325,"We study the effect of the edge disorder on the conductance of the graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). We find that only very modest edge disorder is sufficient to induce the conduction energy gap in the otherwise metallic GNRs and to lift any difference in the conductance between nanoribbons of different edge geometry. We relate the formation of the conduction gap to the pronounced edge disorder induced Anderson-type localization which leads to the strongly enhanced density of states at the edges, formation of surface-like states and to blocking of conductive paths through the ribbons."
1733326,"Exotic states in the charmonium family are systematically treated in the framework of simplest model with an effective coulomb-like interaction of heavy quark and antiquark in the presence of static excitation of quark-gluon modes responsible for a nonperturbative term of potential, which provides with the confinement of quarks, in terms of bag over the threshold in the excitation spectrum of vacuum fields. Once the spectrum has got quite a wide mass gap, it allows us to approximate the bag contribution into the potential by a constant value of bag mass at low distances less than the bag size. The bag mass can be evaluated in a constituent model. The analysis is given for the bag contribution into the distribution over the invariant mass of two pions in the hadronic transition between the S-wave states of bag-quarkonium and heavy quarkonium, that leads to the anomaly violating the chiral limit in the region of low invariant masses, which agrees with the observational data. Leptonic constants of vector states are investigated in the presence of exotic states in the framework of quasilocal sum rules. The extra states allow us to improve the consistency of describing the measured widths of leptonic decays for the complete set of vector states in the charmonium family."

1733328,Accretion onto a compact object must occur through a disc when the material has some initial angular momentum. Thin discs and the thicker low radiative efficiency accretion flows (LRAFs) are solutions to this problem that have been widely studied and applied. This is an introduction to these accretion flows within the context of X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables.
1733329,"Most of the X-ray emitting gas in early-type galaxies probably originates from red giant mass loss and here we model the interaction between this stellar mass loss and the hot ambient medium. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we adopt a temperature for the ambient medium of 3E6 K along with a range of ambient densities and stellar velocities. When the stellar velocity is supersonic relative to the ambient medium, a bow shock occurs, along with a shock driven into the stellar ejecta, which heats only a fraction of the gas. Behind the bow shock, a cool wake develops but the fast flow of the hot medium causes Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to grow and these fingers are shocked and heated (without radiative cooling). Along with the mixing of this wake material with the hot medium, most of the stellar ejecta is heated to approximately the temperature of the hot ambient medium within 2 pc of the star. With the addition of radiative cooling, some wake material remains cool (< 1E5 K), accounting for up to 25% of the stellar mass loss. Less cooled gas survives when the ambient density is lower or when the stellar velocity is higher than in our reference case. These results suggest that some cooled gas should be present in the inner part of early-type galaxies that have a hot ambient medium. These calculations may explain the observed distributed optical emission line gas as well as the presence of dust in early-type galaxies. Comment: 57 pages, which includes 27 figures; ApJ, in press.

1733330,"The one dimensional distribution of a L\'{e}vy process is not known in general even though its characteristic function is given by the famous L\'{e}vy-Khinchine theorem. This article gives an exact series representation for the one dimensional distribution of a L\'{e}vy process satisfying certain moment conditions. Moreover, this work clarifies an old result by Cram\'{e}r on Edgeworth expansions for the distribution function of a L\'{e}vy process."
1733331,"Invariance under modular transformations and spectral flow restrict the possible spectra of superconformal field theories (SCFT). This paper presents a technique to calculate the number of constraints on the polar spectra of N=(2,2) and N=(4,0) SCFT's by analyzing the elliptic genus. The polar spectrum corresponds to the principal part of a Laurent expansion derived from the elliptic genus. From the point of view of the AdS_3/CFT_2 correspondence, these are the states which lie below the cosmic censorship bound in classical gravity. The dimension of the space of elliptic genera is obtained as the number of coefficients of the principal part minus the number of constraints. As an additional illustration of the technique, the constraints on the spectrum of N=4 topologically twisted Yang-Mills on CP^2 are discussed."
